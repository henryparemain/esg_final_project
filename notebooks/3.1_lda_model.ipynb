She encouraged the women to use skills they had learned from P.A.C.E. and helped them write a letter to the government about the perilous bridge.

Many water issues are based on local context, and with better visibility, we aim to enhance transparency, set more ambitious targets, and improve water impacts across our supply chain. We have mapped all preferred wet-processing facilities — representing 100 percent of our business for Tier 1 and about 65 percent for Tier 2 — against the WWF Water Basin Risk Assessment to help us prioritize areas of focus. Through our Mill Sustainability Program, we engage our strategic mills using key industry tools and initiatives to help us meet our long-term commitments. All our strategic mills must participate, enabling us to align our approach with industry standards, increase transparency, and drive innovation.

      "Keeping employees safe during COVID-19 As the COVID-19 pandemic posed ongoing safety risks in 2021, we continued to take steps to protect our workers and reduce the risk of transmission in our workplaces. We continuously adapted our strategy and practices through a science-based approach, and we adjust to new governmental and regulatory regulations where and when needed. Employees were informed of safety best practices through trainings, updated signage, videos, frequent communication from leadership, and updates via our dedicated internal COVID-19 website. For our onsite workers, we employed administrative, engineering, and environmental controls such as face masks, temperature monitoring, social distancing, sanitization, workforce segmentation, enhanced indoor air quality controls, and offered free onsite testing and vaccination clinics. We also focused on expanded workplace flexibility to improve and allow for remote work where possible.\n",

As part of this work, Hecla retained the Governance & Accountability Institute (G&A), a respected advisor on ESG issues, to perform an independent third-party assessment. The assessment began by examining a range of key stakeholders, including investors, customers, employees and ESG rating organizations, as well as studying industry peers, to conduct a materiality analysis for ESG topics. Topics included each of the GRI Standards Topics, the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the SASB Metal and Mining 2018 Sustainability Accounting Standard, and other ESG topics of interest to investors and other important stakeholders.\n",

      "Short Term (0-3 Years) Defined risks and opportunities are generally specific in nature and have a higher impact to the business today. We are currently seeing a greater shift in terms of legislation e.g. the introduction in the UK of the Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards (MEES) for commercial and domestic property and the tightening of regulations around ‘in use’ building performance measures. We have an opportunity to collaborate with our occupiers to deliver significant reductions in Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions across our portfolio, ultimately providing cost savings for our tenants. Medium Term (3-5 years) The period the Group regularly reviews forecasts and which will often encompass the lifetime of major development projects. There will be a need to decarbonise our buildings and ensure resilience to climate change, if we can be seen to be doing this then this may give rise to a higher market demand for these types of buildings, there is also a risk that there is a lower demand for those assets that do not meet these criteria and are no longer fit for purpose. Long Term (5-15 years) More broader risks which have a wider impact on in the Group’s strategy and will help define how the Group will look to operate in the long term. Speed of market transformation and technological progress may impact on our ability to decarbonise our business. We will have to continue to invest in our existing portfolio and development pipeline to ensure they are climate resilient.\n",

    "As can be seen, the smallest disparity is for the G scores, with the largest disparity being the E scores. This disparity is unsurprising. The Sustainalytics Scores (where the historical scores come from) take into a wide variety of factors and data sources. The 'score' that I have created is based solely on how much emphasis is given to a certain topic in a report. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, all of the different scoring systems are subjective. Hence, making a direct comparison is not a very useful metric of success for my scoring. What would be more interesting would be to explore the data surrounding the E S and G spaces for each of these companies for 2021. The performance for each company could then be explored. This would show whether there was a link between the emphasis placed on a certain topic in their annual report, and the actual performance. However, this data is hard to come by and is one of the fundamental issues with the current ESG scoring process."
