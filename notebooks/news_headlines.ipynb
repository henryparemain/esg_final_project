They promise good ergonomics, substantial customization and (in some cases) a tinge of nostalgia. It\\'s relatively easy to switch between your Apple devices and other hardware, such as consoles and PCs. That makes them particularly handy if you\\'re playing action games away from home, or just don\\'t want to poke at a touchscreen. These aren\\'t the only strong options for mobile controllers. SteelSeries\\' Nimbus and Stratus models are well-suited to enthusiasts who want an Xbox-style pad. And if you want a makeshift Switch or Steam Deck, the Razer Kishi is your pick.

The airline joined Delta in forecasting a profit during the start of the peak travel season.United executives will discuss results with analysts and media on Wednesday at 10:30 a.m.In this articleUALFollow your favorite stocksCREATE FREE ACCOUNTA view of a United Airlines plane at Barcelona Airport in Barcelona, Spain, on February 27, 2023.Joan Valls | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesUnited Airlines reported a loss for the first three months of the year but forecast a profit for the second quarter, when the peak summer travel season picks up.United joined rival Delta Air Lines in reporting strong travel demand for the spring and summer, despite some predictions for an economic slowdown. For the second quarter, United expects adjusted earnings per share of $3.50 to $4 and revenues to rise 14% to 16% from last year, on capacity up 18.5% from last year.Here's how United performed in the\\xa0first quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, based on average estimates compiled by Refinitiv:Adjusted loss per share:\\xa0loss of 63 cents versus an expected 73 centsTotal revenue:\\xa0$11.43 billion versus expected $11.42 billionFor the three months ended March 31, United generated $11.43 billion in revenue, essentially in line with analysts' forecasts and up\\xa0more than 51%\\xa0from the same period last year. United posted a net loss of $194 million, or a loss 59 cents a share, compared with a loss of $1.4 billion, or a loss $4.24 per share, in the first quarter of last year. \\xa0Adjusting for one-time items, United had a per-share loss of 63 cents, a narrower loss than the 73 cents that analysts polled by Refinitv were expecting, but at the stronger end of a previously stated range of a loss per share between 60 cents and $1.Revenue per available seat mile, a sign of how much money airlines are generating compared with how much they're flying, was up more than 22% from a year ago.Unit costs were up 4% on the year, but down 0.1% when stripping out fuel. The airline paid $3.33 a gallon for jet fuel, up from $2.88 a gallon in the first quarter of 2022.United executives will discuss results with analysts and media on Wednesday at 10:30 a.m.Executives are likely to face questions about growth constraints during the second and third quarters, when airlines make the bulk of their revenue.United and other airlines are planning to reduce flights in the New York area in the coming months in response to a shortage of air traffic controllers, though carriers plan to use larger airplanes where possible.Subscribe to CNBC PROLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSupply Chain ValuesCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelDigital ProductsNews ReleasesClosed CaptioningCorrectionsAbout CNBCInternshipsSite MapAd ChoicesCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

REUTERS/Nick OxfordApril 18 (Reuters) - Companies with a focus on the oil-rich Permian basin are likely to be at the center of the next wave of consolidation in the U.S. energy sector as favorable oil prices prompt cash-rich drillers to tap into the largest source of shale oil.Top producers have built a war chest to fund acquisitions after reaping windfall profit in 2022 from skyrocketing oil prices following Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine.The current oil prices are only making Permian assets more attractive to companies looking to quickly rebuild their depleting assets to take advantage of the world\\'s never-ending thirst for fossil fuel.\"I think we\\'re in a good spot in terms of oil pricing for M&A, somewhere around $80 per barrel is where both buyers and sellers feel comfortable,\" said Andrew Dittmar, CEO of consultancy Enverus.\"For all of 2023, we\\'re likely going to have a very active market and we\\'re gonna continue to see these deals hit.\"At least three analysts have identified Diamondback Energy Inc (FANG.O), Matador Resources Inc (MTDR.N) and Permian Resources Corp (PR.N) as possible takeout targets.These companies have the highest quality of remaining inventory as well as strong balance sheets and free cash flow, making them good picks, said Gabriele Sorbara, managing director of equity research at Siebert Williams Shank & Co.Reuters GraphicsDiamondback ended 2022 with $2.8 billion in free cash flow and proved undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves of 629,418 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), while Matador had $1.16 billion free cash flow and proved undeveloped reserves of 135.2 million BOE.Permian is an obvious target for producers looking to increase their inventory. The shale patch, which lies between Texas and New Mexico, has the necessary infrastructure and is known for high productivity and large undeveloped reserves.Its proven, technically recoverable reserves are estimated at 50 billion barrels of crude and nearly 300 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.Upstream activities had fallen out of favor with investors as producers grappled with rising costs, while facing pressure to return money to their shareholders. But a surge in oil prices last year helped turn the tide.Crude prices in 2022 rose to their highest inflation-adjusted price since 2014. Brent crude touched a record high of $139.5 per barrel last year and has averaged $82.6 per barrel so far in 2023.Andrew Dittmar - a director at Enverus, with a focus on mergers and acquisitions - expects top producers such as Marathon Oil Corp (MRO.N) and Devon Energy (DVN.N) to emerge as likely buyersDittmar also expects blockbuster deals from Exxon (XOM.N) and Chevron (CVX.N) in the Permian basin in the next couple of years. The two companies have already indicated they are open to more acquisitions.Last week, ConocoPhillips (COP.N) CEO Ryan Lance said he was expecting more shale deals, adding that \"consolidation needs to happen\" among Permian Basin energy producers.Reporting by Mrinalika Roy in Bengaluru; Editing by Sweta Singh and Anil D\\'SilvaOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Mrinalika RoyThomson ReutersMrinalika is a business reporter.

Additional information about the Company is available on the Company\\'s website:\\xa0www.eneti-inc.com.Forward-Looking Statements\\xa0Matters discussed in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides safe harbor protections for forward-looking statements in order to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their business. Forward-looking statements include statements concerning plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events or performance, and underlying assumptions and other statements, which are other than statements of historical facts. The Company desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and is including this cautionary statement in connection with this safe harbor legislation. The words \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"targets,\" \"projects,\" \"likely,\" \"would,\" \"could\" and similar expressions or phrases may identify forward-looking statements.The forward-looking statements in this press release are not guarantees of future performance, conditions or results, and involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors, many of which are outside our management\\'s control, that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on information available as of the date hereof, and current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve a number of judgments, risks and uncertainties.

The airline joined Delta in forecasting a profit during the start of the peak travel season.United executives will discuss results with analysts and media on Wednesday at 10:30 a.m.In this articleUALFollow your favorite stocksCREATE FREE ACCOUNTA view of a United Airlines plane at Barcelona Airport in Barcelona, Spain, on February 27, 2023.Joan Valls | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesUnited Airlines reported a loss for the first three months of the year but forecast a profit for the second quarter, when the peak summer travel season picks up.United joined rival Delta Air Lines in reporting strong travel demand for the spring and summer, despite some predictions for an economic slowdown. For the second quarter, United expects adjusted earnings per share of $3.50 to $4 and revenues to rise 14% to 16% from last year, on capacity up 18.5% from last year.Here's how United performed in the\\xa0first quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, based on average estimates compiled by Refinitiv:Adjusted loss per share:\\xa0loss of 63 cents versus an expected 73 centsTotal revenue:\\xa0$11.43 billion versus expected $11.42 billionFor the three months ended March 31, United generated $11.43 billion in revenue, essentially in line with analysts' forecasts and up\\xa0more than 51%\\xa0from the same period last year. United posted a net loss of $194 million, or a loss 59 cents a share, compared with a loss of $1.4 billion, or a loss $4.24 per share, in the first quarter of last year. \\xa0Adjusting for one-time items, United had a per-share loss of 63 cents, a narrower loss than the 73 cents that analysts polled by Refinitv were expecting, but at the stronger end of a previously stated range of a loss per share between 60 cents and $1.Revenue per available seat mile, a sign of how much money airlines are generating compared with how much they're flying, was up more than 22% from a year ago.Unit costs were up 4% on the year, but down 0.1% when stripping out fuel. The airline paid $3.33 a gallon for jet fuel, up from $2.88 a gallon in the first quarter of 2022.United executives will discuss results with analysts and media on Wednesday at 10:30 a.m.Executives are likely to face questions about growth constraints during the second and third quarters, when airlines make the bulk of their revenue.United and other airlines are planning to reduce flights in the New York area in the coming months in response to a shortage of air traffic controllers, though carriers plan to use larger airplanes where possible.Subscribe to CNBC PROLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSupply Chain ValuesCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelDigital ProductsNews ReleasesClosed CaptioningCorrectionsAbout CNBCInternshipsSite MapAd ChoicesCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

       " 'Skip to main contentExclusive news, data and analytics for financial market professionalsLearn more aboutReuters homeWorldBusinessMarketsLegalBreakingviewsTechnologyInvestigationsSportsMoreMy ViewRegisterDeals3 minute readApril 18, 20237:28 PM UTCLast Updated  agoPermian in spotlight as energy dealmaking gathers steamBy Mrinalika RoyA pump jack operates in the Permian Basin near Midland, Texas U.S. August 23, 2018. REUTERS/Nick OxfordApril 18 (Reuters) - Companies with a focus on the oil-rich Permian basin are likely to be at the center of the next wave of consolidation in the U.S. energy sector as favorable oil prices prompt cash-rich drillers to tap into the largest source of shale oil.Top producers have built a war chest to fund acquisitions after reaping windfall profit in 2022 from skyrocketing oil prices following Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine.The current oil prices are only making Permian assets more attractive to companies looking to quickly rebuild their depleting assets to take advantage of the world\\'s never-ending thirst for fossil fuel.\"I think we\\'re in a good spot in terms of oil pricing for M&A, somewhere around $80 per barrel is where both buyers and sellers feel comfortable,\" said Andrew Dittmar, CEO of consultancy Enverus.\"For all of 2023, we\\'re likely going to have a very active market and we\\'re gonna continue to see these deals hit.\"At least three analysts have identified Diamondback Energy Inc (FANG.O), Matador Resources Inc (MTDR.N) and Permian Resources Corp (PR.N) as possible takeout targets.These companies have the highest quality of remaining inventory as well as strong balance sheets and free cash flow, making them good picks, said Gabriele Sorbara, managing director of equity research at Siebert Williams Shank & Co.Reuters GraphicsDiamondback ended 2022 with $2.8 billion in free cash flow and proved undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves of 629,418 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), while Matador had $1.16 billion free cash flow and proved undeveloped reserves of 135.2 million BOE.Permian is an obvious target for producers looking to increase their inventory. The shale patch, which lies between Texas and New Mexico, has the necessary infrastructure and is known for high productivity and large undeveloped reserves.Its proven, technically recoverable reserves are estimated at 50 billion barrels of crude and nearly 300 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.Upstream activities had fallen out of favor with investors as producers grappled with rising costs, while facing pressure to return money to their shareholders. But a surge in oil prices last year helped turn the tide.Crude prices in 2022 rose to their highest inflation-adjusted price since 2014. Brent crude touched a record high of $139.5 per barrel last year and has averaged $82.6 per barrel so far in 2023.Andrew Dittmar - a director at Enverus, with a focus on mergers and acquisitions - expects top producers such as Marathon Oil Corp (MRO.N) and Devon Energy (DVN.N) to emerge as likely buyersDittmar also expects blockbuster deals from Exxon (XOM.N) and Chevron (CVX.N) in the Permian basin in the next couple of years. The two companies have already indicated they are open to more acquisitions.Last week, ConocoPhillips (COP.N) CEO Ryan Lance said he was expecting more shale deals, adding that \"consolidation needs to happen\" among Permian Basin energy producers.Reporting by Mrinalika Roy in Bengaluru; Editing by Sweta Singh and Anil D\\'SilvaOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Mrinalika RoyThomson ReutersMrinalika is a business reporter.

of American Electric Power Inc. AEP moved higher by 0.28% in the past three months. When understanding a companies price change over a time period like 3 months, it could be helpful to look at its financials. One key aspect of a companies financials is its debt, but before we understand the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt American Electric Power has. American Electric Power DebtBased on American Electric Power's balance sheet as of February 23, 2023, long-term debt is at $33.63 billion and current debt is at $6.44 billion, amounting to $40.06 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $509.40 million in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $39.55 billion.Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents includes cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, investors look at the debt ratio. Considering American Electric Power's $93.47 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.43. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than 1 means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry, but average for another.Why Investors Look At Debt?Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.\",\n",
       " \"However, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations. Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

Given the industry’s headwinds, it seems wise to avoid fundamentally weak solar stocks Sunnova Energy International (NOVA), Beam Global (BEEM), and VivoPower International (VVPR) now. Read on….',\n",
       " 'The solar industry, having already faced a slew of challenges in recent years, finds itself in a volatile condition this year as well. The persistent hurdles from supply chain issues and polysilicon price fluctuations have muddied the waters.\\xa0\\xa0',\n",
       " 'With the industry in a state of unpredictability,\\xa0 it could be wise to steer clear of struggling solar stocks Sunnova Energy International Inc. (NOVA), Beam Global (BEEM), and VivoPower International PLC (VVPR). Before delving deeper into these stocks, let’s first examine the current state of the solar industry.',\n",
       " 'According to the Solar Market Insight 2022 report by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie, the United States added just 20.2 gigawatts (GW) of new solar capacity in 2022, a 16% decline from the prior year. This steep drop was primarily due to an investigation into new anti-circumvention tariffs and equipment detentions by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.',\n",
       " 'The utility-scale solar segment was the most heavily impacted last year, with the segment installations declining 31% year-over-year to 11.8 GW, the sector’s lowest total since before the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, commercial and community solar installations fell by 6% and 16%, respectively.',\n",
       " 'After a rough year, the solar industry is expected to face significant uncertainty this year amid lingering supply chain disruptions created by the Uyghur Act and the trouble of qualifying for investment tax credit adders under the Inflation Reduction Act.\\xa0',\n",
       " 'Furthermore, the rapid fluctuations in material prices exemplify the solar industry’s instability. Within the first few weeks of December 2022, polysilicon prices plummeted more than 40%, only to rebound by over 50% in less than a month. According to BOCI Research Ltd., such extreme price volatility results from “extreme inter-segment competition for profits.”',\n",
       " 'Given the persistent uncertainty in the solar industry, getting rid of struggling solar stocks NOVA, BEEM, and VVPR could be wise.',\n",

       " '3 STOCKS TO DOUBLE THIS YEARSunnova Energy International Inc. (NOVA)',\n",
       " 'NOVA provides a comprehensive energy service package that includes electricity, operations and maintenance, monitoring, repairs, equipment upgrades, on-site power optimization, and diagnostics services.

(AP Photo/Matt Slocum)1 of 4Sergio Garcia, of Spain, smiles on the first hole during the second round of the Masters golf tournament at Augusta National Golf Club on Friday, April 7, 2023, in Augusta, Ga. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum)The road to the U.S. Open began this week for thousands of players, with an 18-hole local qualifier in the Houston area on Monday and another in North Carolina on Wednesday.A dozen or so players from LIV Golf already decided to pass by not entering.That includes Louis Oosthuizen, a runner-up at Torrey Pines in 2021 and at Chambers Bay in 2015. By not filing a U.S. Open entry, his only other avenue to Los Angeles Country Club is to win the PGA Championship next month. He currently is not in the PGA field, and at No. 136 in the world, is not likely to get an invitation.Others who chose not to enter and who are well outside the top 100 in the world are Bubba Watson, Paul Casey, Charles Howell III, Ian Poulter, Lee Westwood and Charl Schwartzel.Patrick Reed also did not file an entry, though he could be safe. The U.S. Open exempts anyone from the top 60 in the world ranking on May 22, the Monday after the PGA Championship. Reed’s tie for fourth at the Masters has him at No. 44 this week, and it looks as though he will stay in the top 60.ADVERTISEMENTThe U.S. Open is June 15-18.Talor Gooch is at No. 57 this week and did not file an entry. Without access to world ranking points, he would need a big finish in the PGA Championship to have a chance. That starts with getting into the PGA Championship, and special invitations have not been announced.GolfColumn: LPGA needs to look ahead and not what it left behindLPGA starts majors in Houston, PGA has teams in New OrleansFitzpatrick wins RBC Heritage over Spieth on 3rd extra holeMatt Fitzpatrick beats Spieth in a playoff at Hilton HeadKerry Haigh, the chief championships officer for the PGA, has said he “absolutely” would consider LIV Golf players in trying to put together the best field for Oak Hill on May 18-21.Among the players from Saudi-funded LIV Golf who entered are Sergio Garcia, Matthew Wolff, Marc Leishman and Harold Varner III.Garcia has signed up for the first 36-hole sectional qualifier in Dallas on May 22, the Monday before Colonial. The former Masters champion has played in every U.S. Open starting with Pebble Beach in 2000. The last time he had to go through qualifying was in 2011, when he advanced in a 7-for-4 playoff.The R&A takes the top 50 from the May 22 ranking for the British Open. The deadline for entering is not until June 1.The USGA accepted a record 10,187 entries, breaking the previous mark of 10,127 accepted in 2014 when the U.S. Open was held at Pinehurst No. 2.ADVERTISEMENTThe USGA said 52 players are exempt from qualifying — Ryan Fox and Tommy Fleetwood also are locked in but not yet announced — from the European tour points list last year. It would appear to be on target for its goal of having roughly half of the 156-man field come from 36-hole qualifying.SPECIAL TEMPORARY MEMBERSRyan Gerard and Nicolai Hojgaard of Denmark are the latest players to accept special temporary membership on the PGA Tour, and there’s never been a better time for that.Gerard and Hojgaard — along with Akshay Bhatia, who reached that status a month ago — can take unlimited sponsor exemptions the remainder of the season. They can get full PGA Tour cards if their FedEx Cup points are equivalent to No. 125 at the end of the season. They typically would have only about three months remaining before the regular season ends.ADVERTISEMENTBut the tour is moving to a calendar season starting in 2024. That means that while temporary members are not eligible for the postseason (unless they win), they now will have as many as seven tournaments in the fall to keep playing. The top 125 in the FedEx Cup is not decided until November after the RSM Classic.Gerard began his run as a Monday qualifier for the Honda Classic. He finished fourth, which got him into Puerto Rico, where he tied for 11th. Hojgaard received an exemption to the Dominican Republic event and was runner-up.GRANT STATUSLinn Grant has emerged as Sweden’s best player, a four-time winner on the Ladies European Tour last year along with two runner-up finishes.But she won’t be at The Chevron Championship this week in Houston to start the LPGA major season. And she has been replaced in the International Crown scheduled for Harding Park in San Francisco in two weeks.Golfweek reported the 23-year-old Grant is not vaccinated against COVID-19, and the U.S. requires international visitors to be fully vaccinated.ADVERTISEMENTGrant, who played at Arizona State, is No. 23 in the women’s world ranking.The International Crown on May 4-7 features eight countries each with four players. She was to compete alongside Maja Stark (No. 27), Madelene Sagstrom (No. 28) and Anna Nordqvist (No. 34). Instead, Grant has been replaced by the next highest-rank Swede, Caroline Hedwall, at No. 119.Grant hopes the U.S. policy will have eased in time for her to play the LPGA Match Play on May 24-28 at Shadow Creek north of Las Vegas.SENIOR CUPThe PGA Tour Champions has sanctioned a tournament that combines the Ryder Cup and the Presidents Cup into one competition during the silly season.The World Champions Cup will be Dec. 7-10 at The Concession in Bradenton, Florida. It features six-man teams of PGA Tour Champions members competing for Team USA, Team Europe and Team International.Jim Furyk (U.S.), Ernie Els (International) and Darren Clarke (Europe) will be captains. Each has been a captain in the Ryder Cup or Presidents Cup.ADVERTISEMENTThe nine-hole matches will include formats and singles play, and points will be earned for each hole won in each of the 24 matches played over three days. Teams will determined by the top two from a points lists, two chairman’s picks and the other two spots based on the Charles Schwab Cup standings. Peter Jacobsen will be the event chairman.The event is being run by Intersport and will be televised by ESPN and ABC. Competition days are Thursday, Friday and Sunday, with a pro-am set for Saturday.It will be held the same weekend as the mixed team Grant Thornton Championship about two hours to the south in Naples.DIVOTSCBS said Sunday coverage of the RBC Heritage averaged 4.15 million viewers, up 13% from last year. It was the most-watched final round at Hilton Head in 21 years. ... Lee Smith is the new executive director of The Players Championship. He previously was the general manager at Liberty National Golf Club in New Jersey. Smith takes over for Jared Rice, who will lead business development for the PGA Tour’s championship management division. ... According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Jon Rahm has had 28 rounds in the 60s at the majors dating to 2019, the most of any player. ...

Photo: Jordan Vonderhaar/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesSouthwest Airlines was temporarily forced to halt domestic departures Tuesday following a technical issue.Why it matters: This is the latest hurdle for the airline, which suffered a disastrous holiday meltdown late last year that prompted days of delays, cancellations, and baggage claim chaos.Catch up quick: Sparked by severe weather and made worse by the airline\\'s business model and tech issues, Southwest Airlines saw more than 15,000 flight cancellations in December 2022.According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, only 69.1% of domestic U.S. flights departed on time that month, with Southwest faring worse than other airlines.The embattled airline admitted in January that the debacle had cost it $800 million in the fourth quarter. What did officials say?The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) confirmed at about 10:30 a.m. Tuesday that Southwest had requested that it pause the airline\\'s departures.In a series of tweets responding to Twitter users inquiring about delays, Southwest Airlines acknowledged that delays had occurred due to \"intermittent technology issues.\"About 30 minutes after confirming the ground stop, the FAA tweeted that it had been \"fully canceled.\"What caused the delay?Southwest confirmed in a statement following the end of the flight pause that the disruption had been caused by \"data connection issues resulting from a firewall failure.\" \"Early this morning, a vendor-supplied firewall went down and connection to some operational data was unexpectedly lost,\" it added.What happens next?Even with the end of the flight pause, the delays will have a ripple effect that affects flights through the rest of the day.\"Even as flights seem to be resuming, delays are going to stack up through the day, and some later flights could be canceled,\" David Slotnick, senior aviation business reporter at The Points Guy, said in a statement.At about 11 a.m. Tuesday, there were roughly 60% fewer Southwest flights in the air than at the same time last week, according to Flightradar24, a flight-tracking service.Southwest had a travel advisory in place Tuesday \"in order to provide maximum flexibility\" for customers rebooking flights.Axios on facebookAxios on twitterAxios on linkedinAxios on emailGo deeperNews worthy of your time.Download the appAboutAbout AxiosAdvertise with usCareersEventsAxios on HBOAxios HQPrivacy and termsOnline tracking choicesDo not sell my personal informationContact usSubscribeAxios newslettersAxios ProAxios appAxios podcastsCoursesEarn Axios rewardsAxios  Homepage',\n",

       " \"Even on a quiet day, though, there were still a few big movers in the stock market. In particular, mid-cap stocks Teladoc Health (TDOC 5.68%) and Sibanye Stillwater (SBSW 9.42%) made double-digit-percentage moves higher, rewarding their loyal shareholders. Below, you'll learn more about why these two stocks gained ground and what's ahead for their respective businesses.\",\n",
       " 'Shares of Teladoc Health climbed 13% at midday on Tuesday. The pioneer in telemedicine services announced a new program that could enhance the popularity of its platform.',\n",
       " 'Teladoc said that it is planning to expand its provider-based care service offering to include weight management and pre-diabetes programs. The program had already been available for those currently suffering from diabetes and hypertension, but the move opens up a much larger potential audience. According to its estimates, 42% of adults in the U.S. live with obesity, and 1 in 3 Americans are pre-diabetic.',\n",
       " \"The idea behind the solutions is simple. Teladoc wants to help members lose weight and prevent the onset of diabetes by making optimal use of available medications. In addition, Teladoc's broader range of tools addressing cardiometabolic health should help patients achieve better outcomes in areas like nutrition, activity tracking, sleep management, and handling stress.\",\n",

       " 'Also gaining ground were shares of Sibanye Stillwater. The mining stock rose 10% after getting some favorable news from the precious metals markets.',\n",
       " 'Sibanye Stillwater has considerable exposure to the platinum group metals complex, as its Stillwater business has an interest in the most extensive mining operation for platinum and palladium in the U.S. market. Prices of those metals were sharply higher on Tuesday, with platinum climbing $39 per ounce to $1,087 and palladium posting an even bigger $72-per-ounce rise to $1,566.',\n",
       " \"Unfortunately, those gains are coming only after the precious metals have lost a lot of their luster. Palladium prices in particular rose above $3,000 per ounce briefly in early 2022, as concerns about Russia's invasion of Ukraine caused prices to spike. Palladium is found in only a few places around the world, and Russia is a major producer of the metal, which is used in catalytic converters. Since then, fears about a recession and its impact on demand for vehicles have weighed on palladium demand, along with questions about whether palladium will remain an essential component in transportation once the transition to electric vehicles is complete.\",\n",
       " \"Mining is a tricky business, but better prices in metals markets mean more profit for Sibanye and its peers. If conditions in the industrial economy improve, then it could drive more demand for platinum group metals and send Sibanye's stock still higher in the coming year.\",\n",

Clean Energy will operate the stations. One of North America\\'s largest logistics companies, Mullen Group Ltd. (\" Mullen Group \"), has indicated its support for the initiative as an early adopter and expects to use the network of stations to fuel its growing fleet of CNG-powered trucks. \"Tourmaline is  Canada\\'s  largest natural gas producer, and innovation is at the heart of everything we do. So this partnership with Clean Energy is a natural fit,\" said  Michael Rose  , Chairman, President and CEO, Tourmaline. \"Across our operations, we have achieved significant emission reductions and cost savings by displacing higher-emitting fuels with natural gas. Thanks to this exciting initiative, we\\'re able to help the transportation industry do the same.\"  This initiative will develop critical infrastructure needed to support the adoption of lower-carbon natural gas fuels that are commercially available today. The use of this domestic, abundantly produced and easily distributed resource is expected to result in significant carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) emission reductions and cost savings for the transportation industry in  Canada  . Currently, fueling vehicles with CNG results in up to 50% cost savings when compared to retail diesel prices, on an energy equivalent basis. These CNG stations also pave the way for renewable natural gas (RNG) availability in the future, as the same fueling-station infrastructure that dispenses CNG can be used to dispense RNG.  \"Clean Energy currently operates the most extensive network of natural gas fueling stations and is the largest distributor of RNG in  North America  . We continue to invest in upstream production of RNG and the fueling infrastructure needed to provide the trucking industry a cleaner alternative of operating,\" said  Andrew Littlefair  , President and CEO, Clean Energy. \"This new partnership with Tourmaline will provide  Canada\\'s  trucking industry with an economical, convenient, and sustainable pathway to net zero and will contribute to  Canada\\'s  overarching climate change goal.  \"As one of  North America\\'s  largest logistics providers, the Mullen Group is committed to being a leader in sustainability. We are excited to support this initiative. We have already made a significant investment in CNG trucks and are extremely confident that this technology will play a huge role in the decarbonization of our industry,\" said  Murray Mullen  , Chair, SEO and President, Mullen Group.  Based on the anticipated commissioning of up to 20 stations over the next five years, approximately 3,000 natural gas-powered trucks could be fueled using CNG every day, resulting in a reduction of approximately 72,800\\xa0tonnes of CO  2  equivalent usage per year. This is equivalent to removing 15,690 passenger vehicles from the road. As future demand increases, the capacity of these stations can be expanded, and new stations added, which would result in greater environmental performance improvement.  \"This is an exciting development for  Alberta\\'s  energy and transportation industries and a major step toward a lower-emission future for all Canadians,\" said  Alberta  Premier  Danielle Smith  . \"As Tourmaline and Clean Energy collaborate\\xa0to make CNG readily available for heavy-haul trucks, we applaud their innovative thinking and support this free-market approach to significantly reducing emissions.\"  The first station expected to be jointly owned under the agreement, located north of  Edmonton  , is operational and well-positioned for heavy-haul transport routes with close proximity to key customers and stakeholders. The next stations which Tourmaline and Clean Energy expect to commission in the first half of 2024 are anticipated to be located within the municipalities of  Calgary  and  Grande Prairie  in  Alberta  and  Kamloops, B.C.

       " 'April 18, 2023 (Investorideas.com Newswire) The firm established a beneficial, securitization program, an event worthy of a 14% target price raise, noted Echelon Capital Markets in a research note.',\n",
       " \"Blackline Safety Corp. (BLN:TSX.V; BLKLF:OTC) completed a CA$50 million-plus (CA$50M-plus) lease receivables securitization program with CWB Maxium Financial, and consequently garnered a target price increase from Echelon Capital Markets, reported one of the financial firm's analysts, Amr Ezzat, in an April 12 special situations report.\",\n",
       " '\"The new purchase facility is expected to provide the company with enhanced financial flexibility and improved liquidity as management continues to execute its strategic plan and goal of sustained positive adjusted EBITDA exiting full-year 2023,\" Ezzat wrote.',\n",
       " \"Echelon raised its target price to CA$4 per share from CA$3.50, and the new figure compares to Blackline's current share price of about CA$2.42, noted Ezzat. From here, the projected potential return for investors is about 65%.\",\n",
       " '\"We have increased confidence in [Blackline\\'s] ability to fund itself and transition into a positive cash flow generator as it continues to improve its financial strength and liquidity in a nondilutive manner,\" wrote Ezzat.',\n",
       " 'Though the news warranted a share price increase, the market has not reacted much to it, noted Ezzat. As such, now is an opportune time to invest in Blackline. Echelon recommends it as a Speculative Buy.',\n",
       " 'Blackline designs, develops and manufactures employee safety monitoring technology with a hardware-enabled software-as-a-service business model. Customers may purchase, lease, or for short-term projects, rent equipment.',\n",
       " 'Blackline\\'s leasing program is popular with its customers, evidenced in its growth over the past three years, and, Ezzat pointed out, it \"provides strong client retention.\"',\n",
       " 'The company currently has 270 lease contracts totaling CA$35.4M in gross receivables, with customers including ExxonMobil, Shell, ConocoPhillips, Keyera, Cenovus, and Pembina. Of the total, CA$12M worth consists of the total undiscounted net book value of the leased hardware.',\n",
       " \"The downside to Blackline's lease program, Ezzat pointed out, is it adversely impacts the timing of the cash flow from it.\",\n",
       " 'He explained that typically \"it takes one and a half to two years for a lease contract to catch up to a purchase agreement with service in terms of cash flows.\"',\n",
       " \"With this newly established partnership, CWB Maxium will purchase receivables generated through Blackline's leasing program. Blackline has 30 days after signing a new customer contract to decide whether to the related lease receivables to CWB.\",\n",
       " 'The program \"replaces Blackline\\'s requirement to fully finance its customer lease obligations, with a new purchase facility based on lease purchases of up to CA$15M and US$35M for its safety wearables and area gas monitoring equipment,\" explained Ezzat.',\n",
       " 'The program is for one year, at which time CWB Maxium has the option of renewing it.',\n",
       " \"The securitization program should boost Blackline's free cash flow by about CA$18M in the remainder of 2023 and CA$15M next year, Echelon estimates.\",\n",
       " 'Along with Blackline\\'s strong cash balance of CA$23.5M at the end of Q1/23, the facility from CWB Maxium will afford the tech company greater financial flexibility and \"immediate, nondilutive liquidity while lowering its overall cost of capital,\" wrote Ezzat.',\n",

2023 12:10 PM |  10 min read ',\n",
       " 'Investment will establish a commercial fueling network for heavy-duty natural gas trucks across Western CanadaCALGARY, AB, April 18, 2023 /CNW/ -\\xa0Tourmaline Oil Corp. TOU (\"Tourmaline\") and Clean Energy Fuels Corp. CLNE (\"Clean Energy\") announced today a $70 million Joint Development Agreement to build and operate a network of compressed natural gas (\"CNG\") stations along key highway corridors across Western Canada. Through this 50-50 shared investment, Tourmaline and Clean Energy expect to construct and commission up to 20 CNG stations over the next five years, which will allow heavy-duty trucks and other commercial transportation fleets that operate in the area to transition to the use of CNG, a lower carbon alternative to gasoline and diesel. Clean Energy will operate the stations. One of North America\\'s largest logistics companies, Mullen Group Ltd. (\"Mullen Group\"), has indicated its support for the initiative as an early adopter and expects to use the network of stations to fuel its growing fleet of CNG-powered trucks.\"Tourmaline is Canada\\'s largest natural gas producer, and innovation is at the heart of everything we do. So this partnership with Clean Energy is a natural fit,\" said Michael Rose, Chairman, President and CEO, Tourmaline. \"Across our operations, we have achieved significant emission reductions and cost savings by displacing higher-emitting fuels with natural gas. Thanks to this exciting initiative, we\\'re able to help the transportation industry do the same.\"This initiative will develop critical infrastructure needed to support the adoption of lower-carbon natural gas fuels that are commercially available today. The use of this domestic, abundantly produced and easily distributed resource is expected to result in significant carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reductions and cost savings for the transportation industry in Canada. Currently, fueling vehicles with CNG results in up to 50% cost savings when compared to retail diesel prices, on an energy equivalent basis. These CNG stations also pave the way for renewable natural gas (RNG) availability in the future, as the same fueling-station infrastructure that dispenses CNG can be used to dispense RNG.\"Clean Energy currently operates the most extensive network of natural gas fueling stations and is the largest distributor of RNG in North America. We continue to invest in upstream production of RNG and the fueling infrastructure needed to provide the trucking industry a cleaner alternative of operating,\" said Andrew Littlefair, President and CEO, Clean Energy. \"This new partnership with Tourmaline will provide Canada\\'s trucking industry with an economical, convenient, and sustainable pathway to net zero and will contribute to Canada\\'s overarching climate change goal.',\n",
       " '\"As one of North America\\'s largest logistics providers, the Mullen Group is committed to being a leader in sustainability. We are excited to support this initiative. We have already made a significant investment in CNG trucks and are extremely confident that this technology will play a huge role in the decarbonization of our industry,\" said Murray Mullen, Chair, SEO and President, Mullen Group.Based on the anticipated commissioning of up to 20 stations over the next five years, approximately 3,000 natural gas-powered trucks could be fueled using CNG every day, resulting in a reduction of approximately 72,800\\xa0tonnes of CO2\\xa0equivalent usage per year. This is equivalent to removing 15,690 passenger vehicles from the road. As future demand increases, the capacity of these stations can be expanded, and new stations added, which would result in greater environmental performance improvement.\"This is an exciting development for Alberta\\'s energy and transportation industries and a major step toward a lower-emission future for all Canadians,\" said Alberta Premier Danielle Smith. \"As Tourmaline and Clean Energy collaborate\\xa0to make CNG readily available for heavy-haul trucks, we applaud their innovative thinking and support this free-market approach to significantly reducing emissions.\"The first station expected to be jointly owned under the agreement, located north of Edmonton, is operational and well-positioned for heavy-haul transport routes with close proximity to key customers and stakeholders. The next stations which Tourmaline and Clean Energy expect to commission in the first half of 2024 are anticipated to be located within the municipalities of Calgary and Grande Prairie in Alberta and Kamloops, B.C.About Tourmaline Oil Corp.

|  9 min read Advertiser Disclosure(Tuesday market open)\\xa0Earnings season accelerates from zero to 60 this week—with 60 S&P 500 companies expected to report between now and Friday.Things are off to a roaring start. Of the names that reported during Week 1, 90% topped EPS estimates, according to\\xa0Bank of America\\xa0BAC data. That’s the best beat rate to start earnings season since at least 2012, the bank says.Speaking of BAC, that company became the latest bank to report better-than-expected earnings this morning, joining last week’s crowd of market-pleasing financial institutions. One thing to keep in mind about Q1 and banks, however, is that the turmoil affecting the industry didn’t hit until mid-March, meaning more than two-thirds of the quarter was unaffected. Any related weakness in business might not show up until Q2 earnings.In other market-moving news this morning, China’s Q1 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 4.5% year over year surpassed analysts’ estimates and suggests the country’s economic reopening had a positive impact. The growth rate was up from 2.9% in Q4 but remains below Beijing’s annual target of 5%. Strong retail sales growth charged the economy in Q1.Between the upbeat earnings news and China’s economic rebound, Wall Street trading turned green overnight following yesterday’s late rally. The\\xa0S&P 500®\\xa0index\\xa0(SPX) is trading at better than two-month highs and is closing in on this year’s peak levels. On the less positive side, market breadth remains unhealthy, says Schwab’s senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon. The percentage of stocks above their 50-day moving average remains decisively lower, and there is only so much heavy lifting the large-cap names can do.Morning rush',\n",

It looks like a 26% year-over-year decline in investment banking fees might have been one reason for the overall revenue miss. This is potentially an issue for all the big banks, reflecting what GS called “a significant decline in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions transactions and debt underwriting.”BAC:\\xa0The earnings news this morning was a bit brighter over at BAC, where profit rose 15% to 94 cents a share versus analysts’ average estimate of 81 cents. Revenue rose 13% to $26.3 billion, versus consensus of $25.13 billion. BAC continues to benefit from strong net-interest income, which is the spread between the interest banks generate from their loans and the interest they pay to depositors. Net-interest income continues to be a tailwind for many banks, propelled by the Federal Reserve’s sharp rate increases over the last year.JNJ:\\xa0The giant medical and consumer products company posted Q1 revenue growth of 5%—better than Wall Street had expected—and EPS of $2.68 compared with consensus for $2.50. U.S. sales growth looked particularly solid at 10%, but international sales growth of just 2% might have been hurt by the strong U.S. dollar. Sales in the company’s pharmaceutical business grew 4% in Q1.Eye on the FedThe probability of a 25-basis-point increase next month is close to 87% this morning, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.Stay tuned at 1 p.m. ET today for a speech by Fed Governor Michelle Bowman on the “Considerations for a Central Bank Digital Currency.” The topic is sounds interesting, though not directly related to economic and interest rate trends.Stocks in SpotlightBank earnings continue tomorrow with\\xa0Morgan Stanley\\xa0(MS) and\\xa0U.S. Bancorp\\xa0(USB). Electric vehicles also pull up as\\xa0Tesla\\xa0(TSLA) is scheduled to report Wednesday. But first, we have\\xa0Netflix\\xa0(NFLX) this afternoon.NFLX has projected $8.2 billion in quarterly revenue, up 4%. Analysts expect a rise in subscribers of 2.26 million for a total base of 233 million,\\xa0Barron’s\\xa0reports. NFLX itself no longer releases forecasts for subscriber growth, so one thing to look for is whether NFLX’s introduction of a lower-priced, advertising-supported subscription tier is starting to pay off.Another afternoon report today comes courtesy of\\xa0United Airlines\\xa0(UAL). As\\xa0Barron’s\\xa0reported, UAL surprised investors last month when it forecast a loss ranging between 60 cents and $1 per share for Q1, citing higher jet fuel prices, capacity growth, and lower demand. Analysts had been expecting $0.66 for EPS. Shares dove 12% in two days, and now analysts expect UAL to post a loss of $0.73 per share. Listen for anything company executives say about summer travel trends. Competitor Delta (DAL) sounded optimistic when it reported last week.We’ll talk more about TSLA tomorrow, but for now, keep a couple of questions in mind ahead of its earnings:How will price cuts affect margins?Have investors gotten a ding from every TSLA price cut? Yes,\\xa0Barron’s\\xa0notes, but they haven’t lasted long. Instead, watch for pain points around wherever Q1 automotive gross margins land. In Q4, they were at 25.9%, the lowest in five years (but still above most competitors).Is the economy starting to bite?\\xa0Late last month, the New York Fed reported that auto loan rejection rates rose to 9.1% in February, up from 5.8% last October and at the highest level since February 2017. Various reports indicate the average Tesla buyer is under 40, male, and earns more than $100,000 a year. If rates keep rising and hiring cools even more, what will that mean for TSLA’s core customer?What to WatchHome brew:\\xa0March Housing Starts and Building Permits data this morning were a bit of a mixed bag. Starts came in short of expectations at a seasonally adjusted 1.42 million versus the average estimate of 1.458 million. But permits exceeded analysts’ forecasts at a seasonally adjusted 1.413 million, and the prior month’s permits got an upward revision. Since permits are the more forward-looking metric of the two, the report might be read as somewhat optimistic for the home-building companies.Meanwhile, yesterday’s April Empire State Manufacturing Survey easily exceeded analysts’ expectations and may have signaled a slight rebound in the sagging manufacturing sector. The report appeared to be one factor weighing on Treasury note values Monday, sending yields higher.Talking Technicals:\\xa0Anyone watching the charts would likely chalk up yesterday as positive for two reasons. First, major indices turned around early losses to close higher across the board. Second, the\\xa0S&P 500\\xa0index\\xa0(SPX) closed above 4,150 for the first time since February 7. Real estate, financials, and industrials were the leading sectors Monday.While there’s nothing magical about 4,150, there were many days in the last two months where the SPX traded above that level intraday only to close below it, so it may be significant that selling didn’t block the way this time. Sometimes, but not always, a strong close can translate into follow-through buying the next day.',\n",
       " 'CHART OF THE DAY:\\xa010-YEAR TREMORS.\\xa0The 10-year Treasury yield (TNX-candlesticks) has recently tested near-term diagonal and long-term horizonal support levels. The bulls were hoping for a break around the first of April that failed to follow through. Now, the benchmark yield appears to be on the rise once again. Recent highs around 3.6% level could cause some congestion, but the long-term resistance around 4% could be a target for many technical analysts. Data source: Cboe.

       " 'Thinking capIdeas to mull as you trade or investJune at the Fed:\\xa0Most analysts’ calculations now bake in a rate hike in May, so it’s a good time to look ahead to the Fed’s following meeting in June. The futures market puts its highest probability (65% as of midday Monday) of rates rising 25 basis points in May and then pausing in June, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. But not everyone’s aboard that train, and the probability of another 25-basis-point rate hike in June is on the rise at 25%. That’s up from less than 4% a week ago. Hikes of 25-basis-points in both May and June may be warranted due to stubborn inflation, research firm CFRA said last week.Yield signs:\\xa0The recent rise in Treasury yields is a bit of a head-scratcher considering the softness of so much economic data over the last two weeks, but this isn’t a normal environment. The Fed’s hawkish approach likely means more rate hikes ahead despite sluggish economic signs, so yields appear to be taking the path of least resistance higher for now. In another sense, rising Treasury yields may reflect more of a “risk-on” attitude in the stock market, perhaps suggesting that investors are gravitating toward stocks and abandoning fixed income. If that’s the case, it might reflect trends in investor sentiment, which recently dipped toward very low levels. Weak sentiment can sometimes be a canary in a coal mine for a stock rally, implying that bearish feelings may have peaked. The\\xa0Citigroup\\xa0(C) Market Sentiment gauge recently hit “panic” territory but is now edging up toward “neutral.”Clear as mud:\\xa0Data often send mixed signals, and when it comes to inflation it’s one of those times. Headline inflation continues to show signs of improvement, but core measures and those most watched by the Fed are proving stubborn in their path toward cooling. This could ultimately make the Fed’s job more difficult.\\xa0Take a deeper dive into recent inflation data and their possible impact\\xa0in this new perspective from Schwab’s chief investment strategist Liz Ann Sonders and senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon.CalendarApril 19:\\xa0Fed’s April Beige Book and expected earnings from Abbott (ABT), Tesla (TSLA), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Travelers (TRV).April 20:\\xa0March Existing Home Sales and Leading Indicators, and expected earnings from AlaskaAir (ALK), American Express (AXP), AT&T (T), Philip Morris (PM), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), and Union Pacific (UNP).April 21:\\xa0Expected earnings from Freeport McMoRan (FCX), and Procter & Gamble (PG).April 24:\\xa0Expected earnings from CocaCola (KO).April 25:\\xa0April Consumer Confidence, March New Home Sales, and expected earnings from 3M (MMM), Dow Chemical (DOW), General Motors (GM), Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Halliburton (HAL), McDonald’s (MCD), PepsiCo (PEP), Raytheon (RTX) United Parcel Service (UPS), and Verizon (VZ).\\xa0© 2023 Benzinga.com.

The company posted earnings of $6.61 per share on revenue of $15.13 billion. Analysts called for earnings of $6.06 per share and revenue of $15.03 billion, according to Refinitiv.PowerSchool Holdings – The educational technology stock added 3.5% after Goldman Sachs upgraded shares to buy from neutral. The firm said the company is a leader in the space and can drive growth through international expansion and cross-selling products.Nvidia – The chipmaker saw shares rise more than 3% after HSBC gave them a double upgrade, saying investors aren\\'t fully pricing in Nvidia\\'s \"incredible AI pricing power\" into the stock. The company could extend its 85% year-to-date rally even further, according to HSBC.Chubb – Shares climbed 1% after Citi upgraded Chubb to buy from neutral. The Wall Street firm said the property and casualty brokerage is a buying opportunity, given its \"incremental strength in reserves.\" The firm expects Chubb\\'s \"high-net-worth exposure skew is relatively more insulated from negative inflationary/economic risk.\"\\xa0Microsoft – The tech giant were down slightly with a 0.4% decline in midday trading. Microsoft stock closed about 1% higher on Monday following a weekend report from The New York Times that Samsung phones may move to switch their default search engine to Bing and away from Google.Bank of America – The bank stock was about flat even after the firm reported first-quarter earnings and revenue that topped expectations. Its strong results were driven by higher rates as net interest income jumped 25% year over year. CEO Brian Moynihan said he sees a relatively mild recession in the U.S.Bank of New York Mellon – The bank\\'s shares dropped 0.3% after a mixed first-quarter earnings report. While the bank\\'s earnings came in line with Wall Street\\'s estimates, its revenue came in below expectations. The company posted $4.36 billion in revenue, compared to the $4.40 billion anticipated by Wall Street, according to Refinitiv.Goldman Sachs – Shares slid 1.3% after Goldman Sachs reported first-quarter revenue of $12.22 billion, lower than the $12.79 billion forecasted by analysts polled by Refinitiv. The investment bank also reported a $470 million hit tied to a partial sale of its Marcus loans portfolio.Johnson & Johnson – Shares of the health-care products company declined 2.7% despite reporting an earnings and revenue beat for the first quarter. The company reported adjusted earnings of $2.68 per share and revenue of $24.75 billion. Analysts polled by Refinitiv had estimated per-share earnings of $2.50 and $23.67 billion in revenue. The company reported a net loss of $68 million, or 3 cents per share, stemming from its talc-based baby powder troubles and costs from its upcoming spin-off of its consumer health business. Southwest Airlines – Shares of the airline fell more than 1% after computer issues on Tuesday led Southwest to ground flights around the country. At least 1,500 flights, or 36% of Southwest\\'s schedule, were delayed, according to flight-tracking site FlightAware.Bellus Health, GSK – Bellus shares roughly doubled after GSK said it would acquire Canada-based biopharmaceutical company Bellus. Bellus\\'s stock jumped 98%; the U.S.-listed shares of GSK dipped 1.6%.\\xa0— CNBC\\'s Brian Evans, Alex Harring, Hakyung Kim, Yun Li, Tanaya Macheel and Pia Singh contributed reporting.Subscribe to CNBC PROLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSupply Chain ValuesCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelDigital ProductsNews ReleasesClosed CaptioningCorrectionsAbout CNBCInternshipsSite MapAd ChoicesCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
