      "In 2018, Tesla initiated its Supplier Audit program with the objective to extend our supplier performance \n",
      "evaluation to key environmental and social impact metrics relevant to Tesla’s business. This program extension \n",
      "was introduced at the time when Tesla was transitioning from a small automotive manufacturer to a company \n",
      "gaining recognition as the leader in electrical vehicle production. We recognized that this growth came with an \n",
      "increased ability to impact positive change on the practices of our suppliers, but also with an increased \n",
      "responsibility to drive such change in line with our mission statement. During the program pilot phase, we \n",
      "focused our efforts on suppliers that we deemed high risk based on their industry or the use of potentially \n",
      "dangerous processes and/or chemicals in the manufacturing of our parts.\n",
      "\n",
      "We chose to utilize the Responsible Business Alliance’s (RBA) Validated Assessment Program (VAP) as the \n",
      "basis for our audits. The RBA’s VAP is an audit protocol globally recognized for its breadth of topics and \n",
      "stringent requirements for supplier completion. It covers nearly 200 checkpoints across labor, health and safety, \n",
      "environmental, ethical and management system topics. Audits are conducted by independent third parties that \n",
      "are approved by the RBA, and all auditors must undergo training by the RBA on the audit standard and its \n",
      "implementation ensuring a globally and industry-wide standardized approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "In any case where any priority non-conformance (the most significant type) occurs, our audit procedures \n",
      "require that suppliers undergo a closure audit. These closure audits – which are a follow up to the original audit \n",
      "where the non-conformances were identified – allow suppliers to address all non-conformances in the earlier \n",
      "audits. Additional audits, rather than an immediate suspension of the business relationship, are preferred to \n",
      "improve working conditions and reduce the risk of continued deficiencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "As of the end of 2021, we had a total of 152 supplier locations go through our supplier audit at least once, \n",
      "representing 144 suppliers, or 10% of 2021 spend with our direct supply base. As part of these audits over 4,000 \n",

      "program. While in its initial stages the suppliers subject to the audit were mainly located in China, and the \n",
      "updated criteria expanded the scope to include significantly more suppliers globally. When we started our audit \n",
      "program, we had only just announced our plans for Gigafactory Shanghai. We now have six factories across \n",
      "three different continents, and our production volume of vehicles has grown exponentially. As our global \n",
      "footprint and manufacturing grew, so did our supply base. Therefore, the expansion of our audit program was \n",
      "an important step to ensure that our supplier due diligence efforts continue to reflect the realities of our supply \n",
      "chain and can properly identify and address potential risks within our supply base.\n",
      "\n",
      "The criteria on which suppliers are selected to undergo the Supplier Audit is based on an expanded risk \n",
      "assessment approach, looking at Tesla’s exposure to suppliers financially, as well as suppliers’ location. This \n",
      "criteria determines which suppliers are obligated to undergo an audit, but additional suppliers can be \n",
      "nominated by our commercial and supplier industrialization teams where they see value in doing so or the \n",
      "potential to further mitigate risk. With the expanded audit program scope, we are targeting to cover over 50% \n",
      "of our global spend with our direct supply base.\n",
      "\n",
      "As part of our program expansion, we are building on our ability to influence supplier behavior in a positive \n",
      "way. When a supplier is not meeting our expectations, they are obligated to implement corrective action plans \n",
      "to remedy any deficiencies or non-conformances found during the audit process, regardless of the severity. In \n",
      "cases of the highest priority non-conformances, suppliers are required to undergo closure audits to ensure that \n",
      "their corrective action plans have been fully implemented. In cases of less severe non-conformances, suppliers \n",
      "are still required to develop and implement corrective action plans as well as provide evidence to Tesla that \n",
      "those plans have been fully implemented within our expected timelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, we defined a separate category called Zero Tolerance Violations, which, for example, include any \n",

      "instances are discovered, our supply chain leadership will be informed, and a corrective action plan will be \n",

To \\nachieve acutely-needed \\nchange, ESG needs to \\nevolve to measure real-\\nworld Impact.\\n\\nWhat ESG measures today: Investment Risk\\n\\nCurrent environmental, social and governance (ESG) \\nreporting does not measure the scope of positive impact \\non the world. Instead, it focuses on measuring the dollar \\nvalue of risk / return.\\n\\nIndividual investors – who entrust their money to ESG \\nfunds of large investment institutions – are perhaps \\nunaware that their money can be used to buy shares of \\ncompanies that make climate change worse, not better.\\n\\nAn obvious example of this is measuring the impact of the \\nautomotive industry. One might think that the more electric \\nvehicles an automaker sells, as a percentage of total \\nvolumes, the better its ESG score. However, this is not the \\ncase. As long as a company continues to slightly decrease \\nemissions of its manufacturing operations while churning \\nout gas-guzzlers, its ESG ratings are likely to go up.\\n\\nVehicle use-phase emissions, which represent 80-90% of \\ntotal automotive emissions (included in Scope 3 of ESG \\nreporting), tend to be misreported due to the use of \\nunrealistic assumptions or not reported at all.\\n\\nIt’s easy to see why some oil & gas companies rank higher \\nthan Tesla on “Environmental Impact.”\\n\\n“The most striking feature of the [ESG rating] system is \\nhow rarely a company’s record on climate change seems to \\nget in the way of its climb up the ESG ladder—or even to \\nfactor at all.”\\n\\nESG Mirage: Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nWhat ESG needs to become: Company Impact\\n\\nWe need to create a system that measures and scrutinizes \\nactual positive impact on our planet, so unsuspecting \\nindividual investors can choose to support companies that \\ncan make and prioritize positive change.\\n\\nOn the product front, companies should be required to use \\nreal-world data wherever remotely feasible and make it \\nclear when estimates are provided instead of real-world \\nfigures. An example of this is vehicle “use-phase” \\nemissions, accounting for the vast majority of lifecycle \\nemissions. Automakers' estimates on lifetime vehicle \\nmileage and lifetime fuel consumption vary dramatically \\nand almost never reflect real-world data. Automakers often \\nhave access to this data, but they don’t disclose it.\\n\\nWhen it comes to a company’s employees, it is essential \\nthat they’re treated well, with a system in place to prevent \\ndiscrimination of any kind, that they have a safe \\nworkplace and that they are rewarded appropriately, with \\nsignificant upside if their employer does well.\\n\\nMany ESG ratings evaluate: “Does this ESG issue impact the \\nprofitability of the company?” We need a system that \\nevaluates: “Does the growth of this company have a \\npositive impact on the world?”\\n\\nThis evolution of ESG needs to be championed by \\ninstitutional investors, rating agencies, public companies \\nand the general public. As the world needs to strive for a \\nsubstantial positive impact, we won’t be referring to ESG in \\nthis report. Instead, we’ll talk about Impact.\\n\\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2021-what-is-esg-investing-msci-ratings-focus-on-corporate-bottom-line/\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\nIn 2021, the global fleet of Tesla vehicles, energy storage and solar panels\\n\\nenabled our customers to avoid emitting 8.4 million metric tons of CO2e\\n\\nThe 6.8 million metric tons of vehicle CO2e savings estimate is based on the net CO2e savings during the use-phase of a Tesla vehicle compared to an ICE vehicle with a real-world fuel economy of \\n~24 mpg (of which 0.9 million metric tons was avoided through annual renewables matching for the global Supercharger network and home charging in California). The 1.6 million metric tons of \\nsolar + storage CO2e savings estimate is based on CO2e avoided through generation of zero-emission electricity from Tesla solar panels, including energy stored and later dispatched from our \\nenergy storage products. Geographic distribution of our deliveries (both vehicle and solar), grid mix at the country, state and province level and upstream emissions are reflected in these figures.\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n\\nThe Future is Electric\\n\\n30,000 litres (~8,000 U.S. Gallons) of fuel burned per car\\n\\n70 tons of CO2e released into the atmosphere\\n\\nBurned fossil fuel is extremely difficult to decarbonize\\nas carbon capture is not economically viable today\\n\\n70 MWh of electricity charged per car \\n\\n30 tons of CO2 released, assuming current global grid mix\\n\\nProduction and lifetime use of EVs is possible to decarbonize \\nusing well-established technologies\\n\\nBattery pack is recycled at the end-of-life and used\\nto build a brand-new battery pack, over and over again.\\n\\nLifetime fuel consumption and use-phase GHG emissions\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\nMore Energy Generation \\nThan Consumption\\n\\nTesla solar panels have generated more electricity than has been\\nconsumed by our vehicles and factories between 2012 and 2021 \\n\\nTesla Cumulative Net Energy Impact: 2012-2021 (TWh)\\n\\n\\n\\nForeword 02\\n\\nAvoided Emissions 03\\n\\nThe Future is Electric 04\\n\\nTesla Net Energy Impact 05\\n\\nOur Goals 07\\n\\nMaking an Impact 08\\n\\nVehicle Affordability\\n\\nVehicle Usage\\n\\nVehicle Safety\\n\\nSolar + Storage Product\\n\\nPeople and Culture 21\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nOur People Plan\\n\\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion\\n\\nRespectful Workplace\\n\\nEmployee Engagement\\n\\nDisaster Relief\\n\\nSafety\\n\\nEnvironmental Impact 55\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nLifecycle Analysis of EVs vs. ICE Vehicles\\n\\nReducing Carbon Footprint Even Further\\n\\nGHG Emissions\\n\\nNOx, Particulates and Other Pollutants\\n\\nTesla Semi\\n\\nWaste Generated Per Vehicle\\n\\nWater Used Per Vehicle\\n\\nEmissions Credits\\n\\nProduct Impact 76\\n\\nSummary 117\\n\\nAppendix 122\\n\\nSupply Chain 94\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nBattery Recycling\\n\\nBattery Supply Chain\\n\\nResponsible Sourcing and Supplier Audit Program\\n\\nCorporate Governance 10\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nOur Approach\\n\\nBoard Committees\\n\\nCompensation Philosophy\\n\\nData Privacy and Cybersecurity\\n\\nHuman Rights\\n\\nCover location: Arevon's Townsite Solar and Storage Facility\\n\\n\\n\\n7\\n\\nOur Goals Tesla’s purpose is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.\\n\\nWe strive to be the best on every metric relevant to our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to \\nsustainable energy. To maximize our impact, we plan to continue increasing our production volumes and the \\naccessibility of our products. In more concrete terms, this means that by 2030 we are aiming to sell 20 million \\nelectric vehicles per year (compared to 0.94 million in 2021) and deploy 1,500 GWh of energy storage per year \\n(compared to 4 GWh in 2021).\\n\\nIf we were to achieve such a vehicle delivery milestone through a consistent growth rate, the total Tesla vehicle \\nfleet would surpass tens of millions of vehicles by 2030, and each of those vehicles could save tons of CO2e \\nemissions every year of usage.\\n\\nFurthermore, each product we make must be continuously improved at each step of its lifecycle: from \\nmanufacturing to consumer use to recycling.\\n\\nWe must also improve every metric, including the energy and water used to make our products, how safe our \\ncustomers and employees are and the affordability and accessibility of our products. Each of these themes will \\nbe covered in this year’s Impact Report.\\n\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\nMaking an Impact\\nMission and the Tesla Ecosystem\\n\\nSustainability drives us. And not just our products — it drives our values and mission as a company. It's at the \\ncore of everything we do and is what motivates us in our work. It also matters greatly to our customers, \\nemployees and shareholders. Our products and services are focused on transportation, energy production and \\nstorage — each of which have traditionally been some of the biggest polluters both in the U.S. and globally.\\n\\nTo achieve a zero-emissions future, we continue to implement programs and initiatives at our global \\nmanufacturing facilities and in our local communities. \\n\\nElectricity & \\nHeat \\n\\nProduction*\\n31%\\n\\nTransportation*\\n17%\\n\\nIndustry\\n19%\\n\\nAgriculture, Forestry \\n& Other Land Use\\n\\n15%\\n\\nBuilding\\n6%\\n\\nOther\\n12%\\n\\nGlobal \\nGreenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions \\n\\nby Economic Sector\\n\\nElectricity & \\nHeat \\n\\nProduction*\\n35%\\n\\nTransportation*\\n30%\\n\\nIndustry\\n12%\\n\\nBuilding\\n11%\\n\\nAgriculture, Forestry & \\nOther Land Use\\n\\n3%\\n\\nOther\\n9%\\n\\nU.S. \\nGreenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions \\n\\nby Economic Sector\\n\\n*Tesla-related sectors.

The world cannot reduce GHG emissions without addressing both \\nenergy generation and consumption. And the world cannot address its energy habits without first directly \\nreducing emissions in the transportation and energy sectors.\\n\\nWe are designing and manufacturing a complete energy and transportation ecosystem. We both develop the \\ntechnology behind this ecosystem and focus on the affordability of the products that comprise it. We seek to \\nachieve this through our R&D and software development efforts as well as through our continuous drive to \\ndevelop advanced manufacturing capabilities. \\n\\n\\n\\n1 0\\n\\nCorporate \\nGovernance\\n\\n\\n\\n1 1\\n\\nCorporate Governance\\nIntroduction\\n\\nManagement involvement\\n\\nAt Tesla, sustainability is everyone's job regardless of their position, geographic location or title. Our \\nSustainability Council, made up of leaders from across Tesla, collects data and prepares the analysis and \\ncontent of this report. The Sustainability Council also presents this information to Tesla’s Board of Directors for \\nreview.\\n\\nBoard of Directors oversight\\n\\nThe Board of Directors serves as a prudent fiduciary for shareholders and oversees the management of Tesla’s \\nbusiness — including reviewing the effectiveness of Tesla’s Impact priorities, initiatives and programs and this \\nreport. With those responsibilities in mind, the Board sets high standards for Tesla and its employees, officers \\nand directors; and we periodically add new, highly qualified independent directors to the Board, such as Larry \\nEllison and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson in 2018 and Hiromichi Mizuno in 2020. Implicit in this approach is the \\nimportance of sound corporate governance.\\n\\n\\n\\n1 2\\n\\nCorporate Governance \\nIntroduction\\n\\nSound corporate governance is critical to our mission. We are committed to establishing an operating \\nframework that exercises appropriate oversight of responsibilities at all levels throughout the company and \\nmanages its affairs consistent with high principles of business ethics.\\n\\nTesla aspires to be a “do the right thing” company. Our Code of Business Ethics sets out basic principles that \\nshould help anyone working at or for Tesla avoid even the appearance of improper behavior. Tesla’s Code of \\nBusiness Ethics and our Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on Tesla’s website.\\n\\nIn addition, we believe in regular and transparent communication with employees. We encourage Tesla \\nemployees to share their feedback openly (and anonymously, if they prefer), and provide easy methods to do \\nso. We also regularly conduct employee surveys to identify strengths and opportunities for improvement. We \\nhave a robust action planning process to ensure we proactively address the concerns or feedback.\\n\\nWe also have a whistleblower hotline through which employees can report concerns at any time. Tesla keeps \\ninformation reported by employees in confidence, whether through the hotline or another channel. Our policies \\nprohibit retaliatory actions against employees for raising concerns or making complaints. We are committed to \\nmaintaining an open and transparent culture where it is safe and acceptable for all employees to raise concerns \\nabout policy violations by their manager or colleagues or about the workplace overall.\\n\\nhttp://ir.tesla.com/corporate-governance/highlights\\n\\n\\n1 3\\n\\nCorporate Governance\\nOur Approach\\n\\nOur unique business requires a unique approach to corporate governance. And our mission requires a long-term \\nfocus that we believe will ultimately maximize value to our employees and our stockholders. Our corporate \\ngovernance structure has facilitated several key decisions which might have appeared counter-intuitive to some, \\nbut which have set up the Tesla to achieve long-term success. Some examples include our decisions to:\\n\\n• Manufacture all-electric vehicles (EVs) from the ground up rather than being a mere supplier of EV \\ncomponents\\n\\n• Establish an international network of our own stores, service centers and Supercharger stations despite \\nregulatory hurdles and the significant capital outlay required to do so\\n\\n• Build Gigafactory 1, the largest lithium-ion battery factory in the world, so that we can scale most effectively\\n\\n• Expand into energy generation and storage through the acquisition of SolarCity Corporation in 2016 to \\ncreate a vertically integrated sustainable energy company and empower individual consumers to be their \\nown utility\\n\\n• Deploy FSD city streets beta software to our fleet to develop complete Full Self-Driving capability in the \\nfuture\\n\\n• Compensate our CEO only if other shareholders realize tremendous value\\n\\nThese and other similar decisions were made due to our corporate governance structure and, ultimately, \\ndecisions like these are what differentiate Tesla from other companies and are a significant reason why the \\nannualized stockholder return since our 2010 IPO until December 31, 2021 equaled 65%. At the same time, the \\nBoard continuously evaluates our corporate governance structure, practices and policies, and weighs \\nstakeholder feedback including proposals we have historically received at our annual meetings. For example, at \\nour 2021 annual meeting of stockholders, the Board proposed and recommended that stockholders adopt an \\namendment to our certificate of incorporation to reduce the term of our directors to two years. However, our \\nstockholders did not approve that proposal.\\n\\nThe Board is directly and regularly engaged with senior management and the Sustainability Council and \\nparticipates in robust shareholder outreach and feedback. In addition, our directors have significant experience \\nas either top-level executives at public companies, as successful investors or as entrepreneurs who founded \\nsuccessful organizations.\\n\\n\\n\\n1 4\\n\\nCommittees of the Board\\n\\nThe Board has four standing committees — the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the \\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Disclosure Controls Committee — which are each \\nfurther described in the following pages. Each member of these committees qualifies as an independent \\ndirector under the listing standards of NASDAQ. In addition, as part of our governance review and succession \\nplanning, the Board (led by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee) evaluates our leadership \\nstructure to ensure that it remains the optimal structure for Tesla, reviews the composition, size and \\nperformance of the Board and its committees, evaluates individual directors and identifies and evaluates \\ncandidates for election or re-election to the Board. Committee charters were updated in 2021 to reflect the \\ngrowing risks and opportunities around ESG.\\n\\nBoard role in risk oversight\\n\\nThe Board is responsible for overseeing the major risks facing Tesla, while management is responsible for \\nassessing and mitigating Tesla’s risks on a day-to-day basis. In addition, the Board has delegated oversight of \\ncertain categories of risk to its independent committees, which then report to the Board, as appropriate, on \\nmatters that involve the specific areas of risk that each committee oversees.\\n\\nCorporate Governance \\nBoard Committees (as of March 1, 2022)\\n\\nName Function\\nYear \\n\\njoined\\n\\nA\\nu\\n\\nd\\nit\\n\\n C\\no\\n\\nm\\nm\\n\\nit\\nte\\n\\ne\\n\\nC\\no\\n\\nm\\np\\n\\ne\\nn\\n\\nsa\\nti\\n\\no\\nn\\n\\n \\nC\\n\\no\\nm\\n\\nm\\nit\\n\\nte\\ne\\n\\nD\\nis\\n\\nc\\nlo\\n\\nsu\\nre\\n\\n C\\no\\n\\nn\\ntr\\n\\no\\nls\\n\\n \\nC\\n\\no\\nm\\n\\nm\\nit\\n\\nte\\ne\\n\\nN\\no\\n\\nm\\nin\\n\\na\\nti\\n\\nn\\ng\\n\\n &\\n \\n\\nG\\no\\n\\nv\\ne\\nrn\\n\\na\\nn\\n\\nc\\ne\\n \\n\\nC\\no\\n\\nm\\nm\\n\\nit\\nte\\n\\ne\\n\\nRobyn Denholm\\nIndependent \\nBoard chair\\n\\n2014 X X X X\\n\\nElon Musk\\nDirector and \\nCEO\\n\\n2004\\n\\nIra Ehrenpreis\\nIndependent \\ndirector\\n\\n2007 X X\\n\\nLarry Ellison\\nIndependent \\ndirector\\n\\n2018\\n\\nHiromichi \\nMizuno\\n\\nIndependent \\ndirector\\n\\n2020 X\\n\\nJames Murdoch\\nIndependent \\ndirector\\n\\n2017 X X X\\n\\nKimbal Musk Director 2004\\n\\nKathleen \\nWilson-\\nThompson\\n\\nIndependent \\ndirector\\n\\n2018 X X X\\n\\n\\n\\n1 5\\n\\nAudit Committee \\n\\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for, among other things, assisting the Board in providing oversight of \\nTesla’s accounting and financial reporting processes and the audit of its financial statements, including \\noversight over the integrity of such statements, the Company’s compliance with legal and regulatory \\nrequirements, the independent auditor’s qualifications, independence and performance, the organization and \\nperformance of the Company’s internal audit function, as well as the Company’s internal accounting and \\nfinancial controls, treasury and finance matters, risk management, including data privacy and cybersecurity.

We emphasize structuring \\ncompensation to reward our named executive officers based on performance, and equity awards weigh heavily \\nin our named executive officers’ total compensation, including awards that vest upon the achievement of clear \\nand measurable milestones. Since these awards increase in value as our stock price increases (and in the case of \\nstock option awards, have no value unless our stock price increases following their grant), our named executive \\nofficers’ incentives are closely aligned with the long-term interests of our stockholders.\\n\\nTesla has no cash bonus program for any of our named executive officers and generally does not provide any \\nperquisites or tax reimbursements to our named executive officers that are not available to other employees. No \\nnamed executive officer has any severance or change of control arrangement, except as reflected in Elon Musk’s \\nperformance-based 2018 CEO Performance Award.  A change in control modifies the vesting requirements of \\nthe 2018 CEO Performance Award such that vesting of the Award’s tranches would be measured based on \\nTesla’s market capitalization at the time of the change of the control, without regard to the operational \\nmilestones of the Award. Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, historically earned a base salary that reflected \\nthe applicable minimum wage requirements under California law, and he was subject to income taxes based on \\nsuch base salary. However, he has never accepted his salary. Commencing in May 2019 at Mr. Musk’s request, we \\neliminated altogether the earning and accrual of this base salary. Consequently, 100% of Mr. Musk’s \\ncompensation is at-risk.\\n\\nSimilarly, the compensation program for Tesla’s non-employee directors is designed to be consistent with our \\ncompensation philosophy for our employees, with an emphasis on equity-based compensation over cash in \\norder to align the value of their compensation with the market value of our stock, and consequently, with the \\nlong-term interests of our stockholders. Moreover, while we offer to our general employee population restricted \\nstock units that will retain some value even if the market value of our stock decreases, the equity-based \\ncompensation to our directors has been exclusively in the form of stock options, which have zero initial value \\nand accumulate value, if at all, only to the extent that our stock price increases following their grant, through \\nthe applicable vesting dates and until such stock options are ultimately exercised and the underlying shares are \\nsold. The remaining portion of our directors’ compensation has been comprised of cash retainer payments that \\nare relatively modest compared to peer companies and that may be waived at the election of each \\ndirector. Further, in June 2021, the Board adopted a resolution that all existing directors forego any automatic \\ngrants of annual stock option awards under our director compensation policy until July 2022 unless the Board \\ndetermines otherwise. \\n\\nCorporate Governance\\nCompensation Philosophy\\n\\n\\n\\n1 7\\n\\nTesla builds products with privacy and security at their core\\n\\nWe believe that responsible data management and transparency is a prerequisite for continuous innovation. We \\nlive up to this commitment by providing information and controls in our products that let you choose how your \\npersonal data is collected and used.\\n\\nManaging data privacy is a shared task through all levels of our organization\\n\\nData privacy is a shared responsibility in which every employee and our Board is expected to participate. Tesla \\nhas a large and diverse team of privacy and security professionals from all over the world and across legal, \\nengineering and product organizations, who are dedicated to protecting customer data. Additionally, the Audit \\nCommittee of the Tesla Board of Directors is regularly briefed on incidents, emerging trends, controls and \\ncorrective actions taken by Tesla to ensure we are living up to our obligations and Privacy Principles.\\n\\nTesla’s Privacy Principles\\n\\nTesla is guided not only legally by its obligations under global privacy laws and regulations, but also by \\ncustomer expectations and our Privacy Principles.\\n\\nWe do the right thing with data. We maintain trust by handling data as customers expect, keeping it accurate \\nand complete and properly destroying it when it is no longer needed.\\n\\n• We build privacy into our products from start to finish. Ensuring privacy is an important component when \\nbuilding world-class products and services, from inception to rollout and beyond.\\n\\n• We give customers choices about their data. We put individuals in control by giving them clear and \\ntransparent ways to access, review, manage and delete their data with ease.\\n\\n• We maintain trust through transparency. We are clear about the personal data we collect and how we're \\nusing or sharing it – ensuring that choosing a connected vehicle does not come at the sacrifice of customer \\nprivacy.\\n\\n• We safeguard personal data. We implement rigorous controls and standards designed to protect the security, \\nconfidentiality and integrity of Tesla’s data environment.\\n\\nCorporate Governance\\nData Privacy and Cybersecurity\\n\\n\\n\\n1 8\\n\\nPrivacy from day one\\n\\nTesla’s Privacy Principles and commitments are illustrated throughout all our products. For Tesla vehicles, \\ncustomer personal data is protected from the moment they take delivery, ensuring that by default the vehicle \\ndata generated when driving is not associated with the customer's account or vehicle identification number. \\nTesla also puts customers in the driver’s seat when it comes to data sharing by providing a dedicated in-vehicle \\nmenu to adjust preferences at any time.\\n\\nAdditionally, from Powerwall to Solar Roof, energy products are designed to protect customer privacy. Tesla \\naims to collect a minimum amount of personal data necessary in providing the most engaging in-app energy \\nexperience. In furtherance of transparency, Tesla has developed a seamless way for customers to download and \\naccess their energy data at any time right from the Tesla app.\\n\\nEngaging the security community\\n\\nWe are also focused on ensuring that our vehicles are the most secure on the road. To do that, our team of \\nworld-class engineers works day in and day out to ensure that our systems are always as secure as possible. \\nAnd while some of the best security engineers work at Tesla, we believe that in order to design and build \\ninherently secure systems, we cannot work alone. We work closely with the security research community to \\nbenefit from their collective expertise and diversity of thought.\\n\\nContinuous product improvement\\n\\nTesla pioneered the concept of vehicles that improve and become more capable over time by ensuring that \\nevery Tesla vehicle made since 2012 can accept over-the-air (OTA) software updates. These updates have \\nintroduced new features and functionality that have made our vehicles smarter, safer and more enjoyable to \\ndrive. We have also used the OTA system to ensure that our vehicles are not only as secure as possible when \\nthey are delivered, but that they continue to stay as secure as possible throughout their lifetime.\\n\\nCorporate Governance\\nData Privacy and Cybersecurity\\n\\n\\n\\n1 9\\n\\nHuman rights are core to our mission of a sustainable future\\n\\nThe ethical treatment of all people and regard for human rights is core to our mission of a sustainable future. \\nWe believe all businesses within our supply chain have a responsibility to share our respect for human rights. \\nOur human rights policy is the formalization of our commitment to uphold and respect these rights and the \\nvalues they represent.\\n\\nWe endorse and base our definition of human rights on the United Nation's Universal Declaration for Human \\nRights (UDHR). The UDHR focuses on dignity, respect and equality, without discrimination, for all people. We \\nare committed to upholding these rights and values throughout our value chain — including with respect to our \\nemployees, customers, shareholders, suppliers and the communities in which we operate. We require that our \\nsuppliers will also support and promote these values in their own operations and in those of their own suppliers.\\n\\nAddressing human rights risks is an ongoing effort, involving engagement with our value chain for potential \\nimpacts, incorporating input from external stakeholders and reviewing and updating our own policies where \\nnecessary. With this understanding, Tesla is committed to addressing any potential human rights issues both \\nwithin our own operations and those of our value chain.\\n\\nYou can see our full Human Rights policy here.\\n\\nCorporate Governance\\nHuman Rights\\n\\nhttps://www.tesla.com/legal/additional-resources#human-rights-policy\\n\\n\\n2 0\\n\\nWe have a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to child or forced labor and human trafficking by our suppliers\\n\\nAt Tesla, we are committed to ensuring that the way we conduct our business and dealings with our suppliers \\nreflects our values and our belief that everyone should be treated with dignity and respect. Tesla is committed \\nto ensuring that our suppliers do not use slave or child labor or engage in human trafficking. Modern slavery, \\nchild labor and human trafficking are crimes under the laws of countries throughout the world, but \\nunfortunately continue to exist all over the globe. Our commitment on this front is summarized in our Supplier \\nCode of Conduct as well as in our Human Rights Policy and Responsible Materials Policy, and we continue to \\nwork to ensure that our suppliers uphold the principles in these statements. We look to the Organization for \\nEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Due Diligence Guidelines to inform our process and use \\nfeedback from our internal and external stakeholders to find ways to continually improve it.\\n\\nThrough our commitment to enforce our Supplier Code of Conduct, Human Rights Policy and Responsible \\nMaterials Policy, continuous training and the supplier audit and due diligence efforts, Tesla believes that there is \\nlow risk of, and have found no evidence to date of Tesla causing, contributing to or being linked to modern \\nslavery, child labor or human trafficking in our supply chain.\\n\\nFor more information on our commitment to anti-slavery practices and an affirmation of the values we hold and \\nadopt across Tesla’s business operations and supply chain, including how we assess risks and effectiveness of \\nour actions, please see our California Transparency in Supply Chain Acts Statement and our U.K. Modern Slavery \\nAct Transparency Statement.\\n\\nCorporate Governance\\nHuman Rights\\n\\nhttps://www.tesla.com/about/legal#supplier-code-of-conduct\\nhttps://www.tesla.com/legal/additional-resources#human-rights-policy\\nhttps://www.tesla.com/legal/additional-resources#responsible-sourcing-policies\\nhttps://www.tesla.com/legal/additional-resources#transparency-in-california-supply-chain-act-statement\\nhttps://www.tesla.com/legal/additional-resources#uk-modern-slavery-act-transparency-statement\\n\\n\\n2 1\\n\\nPeople and\\nCulture\\n\\n\\n\\n2 2\\n\\nWhat do we see as impact?\\n\\nOur employees have gotten us to where we are today.

While challenges will arise, Tesla has a zero-tolerance \\npolicy for harassment of any kind, and we will continue to address them head on as we keep growing.\\n\\nWe hire a lot: We created nearly 100,000 direct new jobs in a decade. While many manufacturers are trimming \\ntheir operations, we are growing as quickly as is feasible.\\n\\nPay well: We want to make sure that we pay competitive wages, regardless of the region.\\n\\nSignificant upside potential: Every single employee of our company can receive their grants in stocks or \\noptions. If our company does well, every employee can benefit materially from Tesla’s success.\\n\\nOutstanding benefits: We want our benefits to be an outlier in the manufacturing industry. Among other \\nbenefits, we provide medical, dental and vision plans with no paycheck deductions, 401k matching, life \\ninsurance, parental leave and family building benefits.\\n\\nBuild the future: Who wouldn’t want to work for a company with a mission of building a future we all want? \\nTesla’s mission is not only about making a product that people love, but also about making a real, sustained \\nimpact on transitioning the world to sustainable energy.

While many companies in the automotive industry have been trimming the number \\nof employees and launching early retirement programs, we plan to grow our employee base for years to come.\\n\\nAs we are aiming to produce over 20x more cars by 2030 than we did in 2021, we will need to continue to build \\nnew factories and hire for those new locations. Gigafactories in Texas and Berlin will recruit extensively starting \\nthis year, which means that our job creation will continue to expand for quite some time. \\n\\n\\n\\n2 4\\n\\nNumber of applicants continues to break records\\n\\nBy attracting, developing and retaining excellent talent, we've developed a pipeline of diverse and exceptional \\ncandidates while fostering an inclusive culture that supports them once they become employees.\\n\\nWhether it is through our direct hiring opportunities, internships or workforce development programs, interest \\nin joining Tesla’s mission is at an all-time high. We had more than 3,000,000 unique applicants globally in 2021 \\nalone.\\n\\nWe expanded access to hiring opportunities for underrepresented communities by centering diversity, equity \\nand inclusion (DEI) in our hiring process.

At Tesla, great engineering ideas worth implementing can come from interns, analysts or executives. \\nWe strive to minimize red tape so our engineers can be creative and solve engineering problems that have \\nnever been solved.\\n\\nUltimately, the long-term success of any company comes down to the pace of innovation. It doesn’t matter how \\nfar ahead or far behind our technology is, what matters is the pace at which we’re evolving, implementing new \\nideas and engineering solutions.

We \\nhave long stated publicly that candidates do not need to have a college degree to work at Tesla. This represents \\nan enormous opportunity for high school graduates from underserved communities to join us in our mission and \\ngrow their careers.\\n\\nManufacturing Development Program\\n\\nThis is a two-year program where recent high school graduates in the U.S. start a career at Tesla as a production \\nassociate while continuing their education in automation and robotics at a local community college. Since its \\nlaunch in 2017, we've hired 168 graduates into this program, with active programs at Gigafactory Nevada, \\nGigafactory New York and our Fremont Factory. We also launched our first Manufacturing Development \\nProgram class with Del Valle High School to support Gigafactory Texas in fall 2021. \\n\\nTool & Die Apprenticeship \\n\\nIn partnership with local community colleges, Tesla offers a federal and state certified Tool & Die Apprenticeship \\nprogram in the U.S. at the Fremont Factory, Gigafactory Nevada and Tesla Grand Rapids. These apprenticeships \\nblend on-the-job training by qualified mentors with classroom learning, providing a holistic approach to \\nlearning a trade in high demand. Apprentices learn welding, machining, blueprint reading and other critical \\nskills. Similar programs run in Europe, including at the Gigafactory Berlin where we collaborate with local \\nvocational schools and train students via facilitated workshops, self-led modules and on-the-job exercises for a \\nvariety of roles.\\n\\nPeople and Culture\\nOur Plan #1: Attracting\\n\\n\\n\\n2 7\\n\\nIntroduce a Girl to Engineering Day & National Manufacturing Day\\n\\nTo promote gender diversity in STEM, since 2018, Tesla has encouraged girls to see engineering as a means to\\npursue their goals by participating in Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day. This year, over 1,200 middle school \\nstudents from 140 schools across California, Nevada, Texas and New York joined the virtual event which \\nshowcased a variety of engineering career pathways and inspiring female Tesla engineers through virtual tours, \\nengaging videos and hands-on STEM activities. Similar initiatives take place in Europe, like Girls’ Day, which is \\ndedicated to girls who want to explore future career paths in the industry. Our aim is to encourage and inspire \\nthem via factory tour visits and conversations with our female employees and leaders.\\n\\nInternship program\\n\\nOur internship program continues to be our driving force in attracting diverse entry level professional talent. In \\nour effort to expand access to our program, we attended more than 75 diversity hiring events targeting women \\nand students of Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions, and launched new \\ncommunity Internship Initiatives with Say Yes Buffalo, Breakthrough Austin, TRiO Scholars in Nevada and \\nCollege Track in the Bay Area to increase diversity in our program. \\n\\nK-12 education in Nevada\\n\\nAs part of our agreement to build Gigafactory Nevada, we committed to invest $37.5M into K-12 education \\nbeginning in 2018. This investment is in partnership with the Department of Education and the Education Gift \\nFund, with a focus on initiatives that support the acceleration of robotics, STEAM and sustainability \\nprogramming. To date, $22.5M has been invested across 30 organizations and an additional $17M planned in \\n2022-2023. \\n\\nConference spotlight: Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers\\n\\nThe SHPE National Convention serves as the country’s largest annual gathering of Hispanic STEM students and \\nprofessionals. We met over 3,000 students from various disciplines and had the opportunity to build some \\ngreat relationships along the way with various SHPE chapter leaders in the country.

In 2021, Tesla’s average national wage for manufacturing jobs in \\nthe U.S. was $21.60/hour plus benefits (which, among others listed on the next page, includes an option for $0 \\ncost paycheck deductions) and equity, which is a 2.2% increase compared to 2020. According to the Bureau of \\nLabor Statistics, the mean hourly wage for Production Associates / Assemblers is $18.17 and the median is \\n$17.59. Tesla continuously reviews salary and wages against benchmarks and adjusts to ensure wages are \\ncompetitive. Evaluations for promotions also take place annually.\\n\\nThe impact of stock-based compensation can be material for employees\\n\\nOur employees have benefited enormously from value appreciation of our stock seen through the years. While \\nshare prices will remain volatile and past performance is not indicative of future results, stock-based \\ncompensation brings shared ownership to the workforce, and our employees are encouraged to make a positive \\nchange for the benefit of all. Culturally, shared ownership of the company is one of the most essential attributes \\nof working at Tesla. \\n\\nFor example, assume that an employee received a grant of 320 Tesla shares in 2018 that vested 20 shares \\nquarterly over 16 quarters (4 years). Based on the stock price at the time of the grant, the quarterly vest of 20 \\nTesla shares would equate to $1,331-worth of sellable shares at the end of 2018. However, the same vest two \\nyears later would equate to $14,113-worth of sellable shares per quarter based on the increase in the price per \\nshare of Tesla stock over that period. Employees are also eligible to buy additional stock at a discount through \\nthe Employee Stock Purchase Program.\\n\\nPeople and Culture\\nOur Plan #2: Compensating\\n\\nValue Creation at TSLA, Contributed to by 10,000s of Employees, Had Material Compensation Impact\\n\\n$0\\n\\n$200\\n\\n$400\\n\\n$600\\n\\n$800\\n\\n$1,000\\n\\n$1,200\\n\\n$1,400\\n\\n2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\\n\\nS\\nh\\na\\nre\\n\\n P\\nri\\n\\nce\\n\\n2022\\n\\n\\n\\n2 9\\n\\nCommitted to ensuring pay equity\\n\\nTesla HR offers a Pay Equity & Pay Transparency educational course to everyone in the People Organization, \\nwith a focus on HR partners and recruiters.

Our early years of Model 3 production and global expansion were some of \\nthe most difficult in our history and our employee satisfaction ratings (Glassdoor) reflected that.\\n\\nOur company is in a different phase now. Model 3 has become the best-selling premium sedan globally and \\nprofitability (operating margin) rose to the highest in the industry. This has fueled our ability to expand \\ndramatically and provide career opportunities for many strong performers. Compensation, linked to the \\nperformance of the company, also improved substantially in recent years. \\n\\nThere’s still a lot of work to be done, predominantly when it comes to work-life balance. Our goals have always \\nbeen, and still are, bold. Expectations are understandably high as a result. We recently introduced unlimited \\nvacation for salaried employees and added more family benefits. Both Glassdoor rankings as well as our internal \\ndata show that our employees are becoming happier as a result of our growing success as well as our expanded \\nemployee benefit programs. \\n\\nPeople and Culture\\nOur Plan #3: Retaining\\n\\n\\n\\n3 4\\n\\nMajority of promotions are internal\\n\\nWe believe our employees should have opportunities without limitations. Employees that start in junior roles \\ncan ultimately become company leaders – and many of our long-term employees have done exactly that.\\nUpward mobility in our fast environment is a significant contributor to retaining top talent. We want to make \\nsure that our employees continue to learn and evolve.\\n\\nAs nearly 70% of our leadership is promoted from within Tesla, our employees are surrounded by examples of \\nsuccessful progression. Our global headcount increased by over 40% in 2021. At that pace of growth, some level \\nof external hiring will be necessary. If possible, we do our best to fill each leadership role with an internal \\ncandidate.\\n\\nPeople and Culture\\nOur Plan #3: Retaining\\n\\nHired externally\\n31%\\n\\nPromoted from within\\n69%\\n\\nBreakdown Of New Managers, Executives and Directors in 2021\\n\\n\\n\\n3 5\\n\\nIntegrating Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) principles and practices into the DNA of our company\\n\\nIn 2020, we instituted quarterly diversity data reviews across different divisions. These ensure that we identify \\ntrends across functions instead of simply looking at our workforce at the company-wide level. Executives review \\norganizational demographics and work with their DEI, HR and Recruiting partners to create an action plan to \\nattract, develop and retain talent.\\n\\nThat same year, we also took steps to incorporate DEI principles into talent management. The fundamental pillar \\nin this strategy is consistent and fair performance reviews — a reliable review process leads to more equitable \\naccess to internal opportunities. Since 2020, we have routinely delivered performance reviews to over 99% of all \\nemployees globally. The program has led to improvements in our internal mobility program and employees' \\naccess to career opportunities within Tesla.\\n\\nWe expanded our leadership development team with a focus on providing DEI offerings to all our U.S. \\nemployees. Now all employees are introduced to our DEI principles on their first day as part of orientation and \\ncan continue their DEI learning journey throughout their time at Tesla. From our allyship resources, to DEI Life \\nHacks on our DEI Knowledge Center, to virtual instructor led courses on unconscious bias, inclusive interviewing \\nand inclusive leadership, our employees have access to information no matter where they are.\\n\\nOur Diversity, Equity and Inclusion principles\\n\\nOur DEI team uses a people-first and data-driven approach to champion diversity, equity and inclusion in our \\nbusiness and in the communities in which we operate. We rely on the following guiding principles:\\n\\n• Provide transparency in our DEI programs, identify areas of improvement, celebrate successes and \\ncontinually iterate and improve our DEI approach\\n\\n• Integrate accountability measures into our business operations\\n\\n• Focus on sustainable solutions that solve problems at the root cause and reimagine new programs with DEI \\nprinciples embedded in the design\\n\\n• Share knowledge throughout all levels of the organization to aid in personal and professional learning and \\ndevelopment\\n\\nPeople and Culture\\nOur Plan #4: DE&I Throughout\\n\\n\\n\\n3 6\\n\\nPeople and Culture\\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion\\n\\nDiversity data (EEO-1) for U.S. employees: Tesla is a majority-minority company\\n\\nWe are proud to be a majority-minority company with a large representation of employees from communities \\nthat have long struggled to break through the historic roadblocks to equal opportunity in the U.S. As of \\nDecember 31, 2020, 34% of our directors and vice presidents were non-white. This is a large percentage, \\nconsidering that just 0.3% of our employees are director level and above at Tesla.\\n\\nWe are working to increase minority representation in professional and management categories through our \\nintentional recruiting efforts with Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions, \\nactivations at the National Society of Black Engineers, the Society of Hispanic Engineers, AfroTech, as well as \\ncommunity partnerships with organizations like College Track and Black Girls Code.

Tesla also supports numerous organizations that sponsor \\nveteran hiring and have expanded outreach efforts throughout the country to more military bases and \\ncommunity organizations.\\n\\nLGBTQ+\\n\\nTesla prides itself in being a great place to work for members of the LGBTQ+ community. This is demonstrated \\nby our 7th consecutive 100% Corporate Equality Index with the Human Rights Campaign. Tracking the size of our \\nLGBTQ+ employee base is not a straightforward task for variety of reasons, which is why we will not be sharing \\nspecific figures in this report.\\n\\n\\n\\n4 0\\n\\nOur Diversity, Equity & Inclusion governance\\n\\nOur DEI governance structure supports our business operations. Our Senior Director of People engages with our \\nBoard of Directors to ensure our DEI plans are in alignment with Tesla’s strategic objectives. We also integrate \\nour talent management and learning and development into the DEI functional scope to ensure equitable talent, \\ncareer and learning resources are accessible to all employees. The DEI Director reports directly to the Senior \\nDirector of People and has regular engagement with company executives across the company to ensure that \\nDEI principles are embedded into our business.

Specifically, we expanded our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) and \\nensured our programming was accessible in a remote work environment. We welcomed Asian Pacific Islanders \\nat Tesla to our ERG family. While this was a time of uncertainty and change, through our ERGs, we ensured our \\nemployees felt more heard and connected than ever before as they pivoted to virtual events to promote \\ninclusion across different locations, physical boundaries and time zones.\\n\\nAt Tesla, we strive to have a diverse supply chain and create the maximum practical opportunities to provide \\ngoods and services as a part of the corporate procurement process. We formalized collaboration between the \\nDEI, Supply Chain and Government Affairs teams to ensure local minority, women, LGBTQ+, disabled and \\nveteran owned businesses are connected to opportunities with Tesla. We recognize that supplier diversity \\ncreates a competitive advantage for the company and has a positive impact on the global community. As the \\nsupplier diversity program develops, we will implement plans that encourage increased usage of diverse \\nsuppliers throughout our organization, partner with internal and external stakeholders to identify opportunities \\nfor diverse suppliers and work with external partners to encourage capacity building for diverse suppliers.\\n\\nPeople and Culture\\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion\\n\\nIntersectionality\\n\\n\\n\\n4 2\\n\\nPeople and Culture\\nRespectful Workplace\\n\\nWe strive to create an environment where people love to come to work every day. With over 100,000 \\nemployees as of March 2022, challenges arise, and we address them head on.\\n\\nIn 2021, we re-doubled our efforts to educate employees and managers that any form of discrimination must be \\nreported. While our goal is always prevention, reported complaints of discrimination and harassment are \\npromptly investigated and if substantiated, subject to discipline up to and including termination. New \\nemployees receive anti-harassment and discrimination training during orientation. A new employee guidebook \\nwas also rolled out which instructs employees to report all forms of misconduct without concern. \\n\\nAs the company continues to hire tens of thousands of workers per year, educating our workforce is a top \\npriority and an ongoing process.\\n\\n\\n\\n4 3\\n\\nPeople and Culture\\nRespectful Workplace\\n\\nHow we're meeting our commitments to equal opportunity employment and a diverse and inclusive \\nenvironment\\n\\nWe believe it’s essential to provide all employees with a respectful and safe working environment where all \\nemployees can achieve their potential. As a result, we do not tolerate discrimination, harassment or any \\nmistreatment of employees in the workplace or work-related situations. Below are some of the actions we are \\ntaking to ensure the proper treatment of all employees.\\n\\nTraining: Code of Business Ethics and harassment & discrimination training for front-line leaders, HR partners \\nand other employees to understand how to create and promote a respectful workplace, assess situations sooner \\nand escalate appropriately.\\n\\nInternal Tracking System Enhancement: An enhancement to our internal tracking system now allows HR to \\ndocument all employee concerns that are raised to ensure there is follow through and resolution for tracking \\npurposes. Additionally, handling concerns at the initial stage helps prevent them from becoming bigger issues. \\nThe case management system also allows the appropriate teams to review data to trend and issue spot, which \\nthen can lead to proactive solutions before concerns arise.\\n\\nInternal Mobility: A program that advocates for and provides equal access to employee advancement \\nopportunities and retention with eligibility for opportunities based on standardized performance reviews. \\nOpportunities are advertised on an internal site with career resources in addition to a monthly newsletter. We \\nalso offer 1-on-1 support and personal consultations to understand the career aspirations of internal applicants.\\n\\nThird-party managed integrity line\\n\\nWe encourage employees to raise concerns internally or externally. An employee can raise concerns or \\ncomplaints to any member of management, Human Resources or Employee Relations (ER). If they prefer to \\nreport another way, the Integrity Line is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The Integrity Line allows \\nemployees to report concerns anonymously and without fear of retaliation.\\n\\nIf any employee raises a good faith concern, HR, together with ER, will ensure that employee concerns are \\ninvestigated promptly and impartially in a manner appropriate to the circumstances. The Employee Relations \\nteam engages in feedback loops with leaders and HR to provide guidance on any appropriate follow-up actions, \\nwhich range from additional communication and training to corrective action and discipline up to termination of \\nemployment.\\n\\n\\n\\n4 4\\n\\nWhy engagement matters for retention\\n\\nEmployee engagement drives productivity, satisfaction and loyalty and plays a critical role in employee \\nretention. Tesla’s engagement initiatives strive to make employees feel informed, valued and respected, while \\ncompany-wide open-door policies with leaders empower employees to make their ideas heard. When we feel \\nconnected to the Tesla community and mission, we unlock our full potential as a workforce.\\n\\nWhat we are doing to keep employees engaged\\n\\nTo promote engagement, we lead initiatives driven by employee feedback. Throughout the year, we use \\nroundtables, engagement surveys and other feedback forms to gather data and better understand the \\nemployee experience.\\n\\nOur team uses this data to inform our communication strategies. In addition to a monthly newsletter emailed to \\nall U.S. employees and physically posted at manufacturing sites, we launched a new company-wide internal \\nnews platform with weekly updates on company news, employee recognition and events.\\n\\nWe highlight business, people and safety updates via both email and an expansive network of video screens. In \\n2021, we also produced two live and virtual companywide all-hands.\\n\\nThese channels pair with the revitalization of daily Start-Up meetings for assembly workers to streamline \\ncommunications across the Fremont Factory. HR members also staff on-site Answer Bar kiosks to address \\nemployee questions and concerns at many of our office locations.\\n\\nEngagement requires making resources more accessible. This translates to regular on-site tabling and fairs for \\nbenefits, as well as making information available digitally. We manage internal resource websites for product \\nknowledge, employee perks, recognition, employee volunteering, health and fitness and offer virtual info \\nsessions with subject matter experts.\\n\\nPeople and Culture\\nEmployee Engagement\\n\\n\\n\\n4 5\\n\\nPeople and Culture\\nDisaster Relief\\n\\nSupporting Ukraine\\n\\nWe are committed to providing disaster relief through product donations. Our relief efforts to the conflict in \\nUkraine have provided people with the ability to communicate and power communities. \\n\\nIn March 2022, Tesla employees in Europe volunteered to design, prototype and deploy the first 50 kits \\ncontaining Powerwalls, Gateways and solar inverters to support continued energy access in Ukraine. When \\npaired with one of the 250 solar panels dispatched by volunteers at Gigafactory Berlin, these mini power plants \\ncan assist Ukrainian communications and essential services indefinitely by using solar to recharge Powerwalls.\\n\\nAlong with Starlink Terminals used for satellite internet access (made by SpaceX), the kits were shipped to the \\nUkranian border in Poland, at which point they were transferred onto military trucks. The kit can begin providing \\npower almost instantly, without any tools or technical experience required. With the Powerwall kit alone, a user \\ncan power Starlink for five days. With solar panels installed and operational, the kits can provide indefinite \\npower for Starlink Terminal, plus a small appliance or laptop.\\n\\nSurrounding European countries\\n\\nIn addition to product donations, Tesla has opened free Supercharging at all stations in Poland, Slovakia and \\nHungary to support those impacted by the recent events. Within hours of implementation, Tesla emailed local \\nowners announcing that several Supercharger stations near Ukraine could be used by Tesla and non-Tesla \\nelectric vehicles, free-of-charge.\\n\\n\\n\\n4 6\\n\\nPeople and Culture\\nDisaster Relief\\n\\nHurricane Ida\\n\\nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Ida, Tesla worked with NGO partners such as the Footprint Project, and certified \\ninstallers in the New Orleans Area (Solar Alternatives, Posigen) to deploy Powerwall and solar panel disaster \\nrelief systems. We deployed 14 systems to over 10 sites, including food distribution centers, churches, a \\nwarehouse, a fire station, a shelter and command center for NGOs. Most systems stayed in place for six weeks \\nwhile the grid was down; in cases where the building was too damaged to return power after the grid was back \\nup the systems remained in place for substantially longer. Our partners estimate that these systems provided \\npower to over 1,000 people including recovery workers, food distribution volunteers and first responders.\\n\\nKentucky Storms\\n\\nAfter the Kentucky winter storms, we deployed two systems at a research and education center in Princeton, \\nKentucky in partnership with the Footprint Project. These systems helped power communications trailers and \\nmobile offices for over 50 recovery workers. They are still deployed while the center is being rebuilt and we are \\nexploring ways to turn the trailers and mobile offices into a training center for future recovery workers.\\n\\nTexas Winter Storm\\n\\nIn February 2021, Texas experienced a weather event that caused the widespread loss of power for several days \\naffecting thousands of residents. Tesla provided a disaster relief system to Pathways Youth & Family Services, \\nInc., a non-profit social service organization providing foster care, adoption and behavioral health services to \\ncommunities across Texas. The system consisted of four mobile Powerwall units (for a total of ~100kWh of \\nbatteries and 40kW of power). With this system, Pathways was able to restore heat and power to its facilities, \\nenabling it to resume housing and other social services to children.\\n\\n\\n\\n47\\n\\nIn 2021, our focus remained on protecting people, the planet, our property and products. We were able to \\nimprove our performance in Environmental, Health, Safety and Security (EHS&S) by turning to the experts in \\nTesla – our own employees. We evolved the way we define safety, developed internal tools to drive execution, \\nactively sought worker improvement suggestions and established a more structured EHS&S audit program to \\nidentify safeguards and drive operational excellence throughout all areas of the business.\\n\\nOur EHS&S strategy remains focused on three pillars:\\n\\n1. Do the Basics Right | 2. Engage and Empower Our Stakeholders | 3. Reduce Risk\\n\\nChanging how we define safety and build capacity: Human and Organizational Performance (HOP) and \\nOperational Learning\\n\\nAs we grew and evolved as an EHS&S organization, so did our view of safety. The Human and Organizational \\nPerformance (HOP) and Operational Learning group was developed in 2021 to integrate our new view of safety \\ninto the organization.\\n\\nIn an ever-changing and dynamic work environment, we recognized the need to focus on creating the ability to \\nfail safely. Creating the ability to fail safely is comprised of three components:\\n\\n1. Engaged workers: workers who are connected to and care about the work they do. When workers are \\nengaged, they are more likely to identify and communicate vulnerabilities in the system.\\n\\n2. Agility: the ability to continuously navigate and adapt in an ever-changing, complex and dynamic work \\nenvironment.\\n\\n3. Safeguards: the hardware, software and human actions that directly prevent an event or mitigate a bad \\noutcome.\\n\\nInstead of defining safety as the absence of accidents, we define safety as the presence of capacity. Capacity \\ncan be defined as the ability to mitigate outcomes and reduce system brittleness.\\n\\nPeople and Culture\\nSafety\\n\\n\\n\\n4 8\\n\\nDevelop tools to drive execution of EHS&S — MyEHS\\n\\nIn order to build capacity and allow our workers to fail safely, we needed a more dynamic approach to how we \\ncollect and manage data that allows us to make decisions that reduce risk. In response to that need, we \\ndeveloped an internal EHS&S tool named MyEHS to help drive execution and improve outcomes by allowing the \\nintake and visualization of data globally. We designed and deployed 11 modules in 2021, allowing us to better \\nmanage our EHS&S information, identify emerging risks and take action to implement improvements suggested \\nby our employees.\\n\\nForemost in this effort was our improvement suggestion module — Take Charge. Combined with Action Tracker, \\nthis module allows workers to submit improvement suggestions in various categories, including environment, \\nhealth, safety, security, people and accuracy, while connecting with their supervisors and other work groups to \\nidentify and implement solutions to improve the presence of safeguards.\\n\\nTake Charge case study — Sherry Ihrig\\n\\nLeading the way with Take Charge submissions is Sherry Ihrig, with over 1,800 improvement suggestions to \\nsafety, processes, cost-savings and more since the program’s start in early 2021.\\n\\n“Tesla promotes the concept that ‘safety is a shared responsibility,’ and the Take Charge program truly \\nempowers me to take a more active role in sharing that responsibility,” Ihrig said.\\n\\n“The Take Charge program encourages associates to increase their awareness of the work environment,” Ihrig\\nsaid. “When these and other potential safety hazards are noticed and resolved, it allows associates to improve \\ntheir overall work performance.”\\n\\nWhile Ihrig has enjoyed many parts of her experience at Tesla, from teaming up with “hardworking, outgoing \\nindividuals” to learning how to operate a fire extinguisher in emergency response training, the most exciting \\npart has been the Take Charge program.\\n\\nEngaged employees like Sherry help Tesla build capacity to ensure safeguards are in place and functioning, so \\nthat when we fail, we fail safely.\\n\\nPeople and Culture\\nSafety – MyEHS & Take Charge\\n\\n48,779 submissions \\n72% of submissions closed with action\\n\\nMeet Sherry Ihrig – Take Charge Champion\\n\\n\\n\\n4 9\\n\\nPeople and Culture\\nSafety – Protecting our People\\n\\nCOVID-19 response \\n\\nSince the emergence of COVID-19 in 2019 and the subsequent variants, we have proactively protected our \\nworkers.

We have conducted 31 audits so far that:\\n\\n• Focused on compliance with Tesla EHS&S standards and regulatory requirements\\n• Engaged site-level EHS&S professionals to audit other Tesla sites, maximizing technical knowledge across the \\n\\nbusinesses\\n• Identified best practices that can be replicated across other sites\\n• Provided guidance and assistance to sites addressing and closing out corrective and preventive actions\\n\\nThe audit outcomes provided opportunities for workers to identify and employ improvement solutions, adjust \\nto the changing work environment where necessary, verify and validate existing safeguards, and implement new \\nsafeguards and improve our overall capacity.\\n\\n\\n\\n50\\n\\nPeople and Culture\\nSafety – Protecting our People\\n\\nU.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) application \\naccepted in GF Nevada\\n\\nGigafactory Nevada became the first Tesla site to have a Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) application \\naccepted. VPP is an OSHA program that recognizes employers in the private industry who have implemented \\neffective safety and health management systems and maintain injury and illness rates below national Bureau of \\nLabor Statistics averages for their respective industries. Next step will be a rigorous onsite evaluation by a team \\nof health and safety professionals in May 2022.\\n\\nSecurity\\n\\nSecurity of our people, the planet, our property and products continues to be a core factor to enable \\nproduction execution and build capacity throughout our entire organization.\\n\\nOur manufacturing locations have dedicated physical and technical security teams, while at our service centers \\nand remote sites, we augment physical security with our SHIELD ambassadors. SHIELD is Tesla's Security \\nAmbassador project that helps increase security awareness at all Tesla locations, especially those without an \\non-site security team.\\n\\nThe Tesla SHIELD program is designed to educate individuals with the basic security requirements for their \\nbuilding, to allow them to present the issues to their site manager for resolution and be able to escalate larger \\nissues to the Security Team for support.\\n\\n• 271 Security SHIELD Ambassadors registered at 176 locations across 24 countries to help support on-site \\nsecurity needs\\n\\n• 37,154 workers trained in basic security and awareness courses\\n\\n\\n\\n51\\n\\nPeople and Culture\\nSafety – Metrics\\n\\nAs our production volumes increase, focus on safety remains strong\\n\\nAs we continue to increase production, our focus remains on maintaining positive safety records. We examine \\nour safety data to identify emerging risks, comparable events for innovative solutions and to better understand \\nhow we can systematically improve across our highest risk areas to help keep our people, the planet, our \\nproducts and property safe.\\n\\nWe have turned our attention away from traditional OSHA metrics, but we continue to maintain information on \\nthem for regulatory purposes. We use these metrics, amongst many others, to examine how how we can see the \\nresults of our commitment to safety.\\n\\nThis will be the last year that we present recordable injuries per car produced – which captures all injuries and \\nillness regardless of their severity or relation to work. Instead, we will use the American Society for Testing and \\nMaterials (ASTM) standard E2920-19.

This level of involvement resulted in increased contractor \\nresponsibility, improved communication and more thorough Pre-Work Risk Assessments, which identified \\ncritical and high-risk activities.\\n\\nShifting from a hazard-based approach to a risk-based approach provides a better opportunity for EHS&S \\nsuccess by discussing critical and high-risk operations.\\n\\nIn addition, we support the Constructing Our Future with written procedures, training resources and forms \\nwhich are easily accessible to Tesla stakeholders. This strategic approach helps us create the framework \\nnecessary to build safely, efficiently and consistently.\\n\\nWe are on schedule to release the new and improved supplier and contractor onboarding and management \\nsystem, Workforce Management, in the second quarter of 2022.

Additionally, we want to displace fossil-based energy generation with renewable energy generation. \\n\\nAs of the end of 2021, Tesla (including SolarCity prior to its 2016 acquisition by Tesla) has installed almost 4.0 \\nGigawatts of solar systems and cumulatively generated over 25.0 Terawatt-hours (TWhs) of emissions-free \\nelectricity. For reference, that is more energy generated by our installations than the total energy Tesla has used \\nto run all our factories since we began producing Model S in 2012 and electricity used to power all of our \\nvehicles in that same period combined.\\n\\nWe are striving to always remain a net contributor to renewable energy generation. It is our goal to eventually \\nhave all our manufacturing energy needs satisfied through renewable sources where possible. Additionally, we \\nare hoping to see more Tesla vehicle customers installing solar panels or Solar Roof along with a Powerwall to \\nmeet their own energy needs in a sustainable way.\\n\\nEnergy Generation vs. Energy Consumption (in TWh)\\n\\n\\n\\n57\\n\\nIntroduction In addition to an updated Lifecycle Analysis (LCA) for Model 3 and Model Y, we are reporting total Scope 1 and \\nScope 2 emissions and use-phase emissions of our vehicles\\n\\nIn this year’s report we are reporting our Scope 1 (direct emissions from our facilities) and Scope 2 (purchased \\nelectricity, heat, etc. for our facilities) emissions resulting from global operations. This information is not only \\nimportant to benchmark our performance against other manufacturers but is also the first step to track \\nprogress as we continue to work to decarbonize our own operations. While the most important work we can do \\nto reduce GHG emissions is through selling as many of our products as possible, we are also committed to \\nreducing carbon emitted from our own operations longer term. This is not only the right thing to do, but it also \\nmakes business sense as we reduce the resource intensity of our processes. \\n\\nIt is possible to fully decarbonize the manufacturing and use of EVs – this is economically unfeasible for ICE \\nvehicles\\n\\nWe are often asked if electric vehicles (EVs) are more sustainable than internal combustion engine (ICE) \\nvehicles. The environmental impact of zero-emission transport and energy products, like the products that Tesla \\nproduces and sells, is undeniably more positive than the GHG-emitting alternatives. This becomes more \\npronounced when determining the lifetime impact of EVs versus ICE vehicles, which requires looking at the \\nentire lifecycle — from raw materials to use-phase emissions to disposal — and not just at vehicle usage \\nemissions.\\n\\nVariables often overlooked by other lifecycle studies:\\n\\n• Using Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) or Environmental Protection Agency \\n(EPA) fuel/energy consumption data (both of which overestimate fuel-economy and underestimate \\nemissions) rather than real-world data\\n\\n• Not considering the higher energy efficiency of Tesla’s powertrains\\n\\n• Assuming the average EV needs a battery replacement at some point in its life (it doesn’t)\\n\\n• Not considering emissions generated through the oil refining and the transportation process\\n\\n• Using outdated data for the carbon impact of cell manufacturing\\n\\n6,500 miles\\nThe manufacturing process of Model 3 and Model Y currently results \\nin slightly higher GHG emissions than an equivalent combustion \\nengine vehicle. However, based on the global weighted average grid \\nmix, Model 3 and Model Y have lower lifetime emissions than an \\nequivalent ICE after driving 6,500 miles.\\n\\n*For a definition of Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions see page 135 of this report. \\n\\n\\n\\n58\\n\\nLifecycle Analysis of Tesla EVs vs.\\nEquivalent ICE Vehicles\\n\\n70 tons\\nLifetime CO2e emitted by an average internal combustion engine \\nvehicle (model year 2021) sold in the U.S. through its use-phase, \\nexcluding CO2e emitted during the oil refining phase.\\n\\nUsing only real-world data, not official NEDC, WLPT or EPA1 consumption data\\n\\nThe most important variable in a lifecycle analysis of an automobile is real-world fuel consumption or electricity \\nconsumption, as applicable, which impacts the use-phase of the lifecycle. Various efficiency testing cycles such \\nas NEDC, WLTP or EPA do not truly represent real-world fuel or energy consumption. Therefore, we used: \\n\\nEV energy consumption: Real world energy consumption based on 25 billion miles traveled Tesla Model 3 and \\nModel Y vehicles, including energy losses during the charging process. \\n\\nICE fuel consumption: Data provided by Consumer Reports, which reports model year 2020 mid-size premium \\nsedans achieve 24.3 MPG on average. This translates to over 400 grams of CO2e per mile once we account for \\nemissions generated through the extraction, refining and shipment of oil.\\n\\nThe carbon impact of ICE vehicles remains the same every year of use, but for EVs, it should improve every year\\n\\nBased on publicly available sales and fleet data, we estimate that an average vehicle in the U.S. is driven slightly \\nless than 12,000 miles per year for about 17 years before it is scrapped. Furthermore, as an ICE vehicle ages, its \\nfuel efficiency only remains stable if serviced properly. On the other hand, electricity generation to charge EVs \\nhas become “greener” over time with the addition of cleaner energy sources to the grid. Below, we show zero-\\nemission electricity generation capacity (including nuclear) in the U.S. since 2015. Even without factoring in any \\nchanges to federal policy or an acceleration of the adoption of renewables in the U.S. (which is likely), if current \\ntrends remain stable, emissions generated through EV charging should continue to decline over time.\\n\\n1NEDC = New European Driving Cycle; WLPT = Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure; EPA = U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\\n22021-2040 Tesla estimate based on recent grid mix shifts.

Given that Model 3 and Model Y have 70%+ \\nparts commonality and share many manufacturing processes their GHG footprints are very similar. We have decided to present the LCA as a \\nweighted average of Model 3 and Model Y based on production share for each vehicle (for manufacturing phase emissions) and delivery volumes \\nin each region (for use-phase emissions).\\n\\n\\n\\n6 0\\n\\n0\\n\\n100\\n\\n200\\n\\n300\\n\\n400\\n\\n500\\n\\nModel 3Y\\nRidesharing Use\\n(solar charged)\\n\\nModel 3Y\\nPersonal Use\\n\\n(solar charged)\\n\\nModel 3Y\\nRidesharing Use\\n(grid charged)\\n\\nModel 3Y\\nPersonal Use\\n\\n(grid charged)\\n\\nAverage\\nPremium ICE\\n\\nManufacturing Phase Use Phase\\n\\nThe electricity grid keeps getting cleaner, while emissions from ICE vehicles do not\\n\\nTo put this in perspective, average GHG emissions from charging one New York-based Tesla vehicle equates to \\nthe emissions from an ICE vehicle with a fuel economy of 109 MPG (no such vehicle is on the market). Even \\nwhen charging a Tesla in Michigan, where approximately 60% of energy comes from natural gas and coal, the \\nemissions from our vehicles still equates to the emissions from an ICE vehicle with 52 real-world MPG \\n(considerably more in terms of EPA rated MPG). As more regions adopt sustainable energy solutions to \\ngenerate power, emissions related to charging an EV from the grid will decrease even further.\\n\\nEV customers can increase their renewable energy mix by installing solar panels or a Solar Roof and an energy \\nstorage solution, such as Powerwall, in their homes.

That said, even in this scenario, charging a Tesla Model 3Y from \\nthe grid is still less emission intensive than running an ICE vehicle. Just like in Europe, we have assumed a \\nvehicle lifetime of 150,000 miles.\\n\\nWe are expecting the grid mix in China to improve dramatically over time as China remains a dominant deployer \\nand manufacturer of renewable energy. Sichuan Province (with a population of 81 million) is a great example of \\nthis. In this province, given the high percentage of renewable energy penetration, charging an EV from the grid \\nis less polluting than charging an EV in most global countries or states.\\n\\nIn conclusion, even as of 2021, charging a Tesla Model 3Y in any of our major markets is more environmentally \\nfriendly than burning gasoline. Considering that vehicles are used for 17 to 20 years before getting scrapped, it \\nis reasonable to assume that in the coming years, the gap in emissions per mile between EVs and ICEs will only \\nget wider.\\n\\nEV vs. ICE Vehicle Emissions per Mile\\nChina\\n\\nShift to \\ngreener \\n\\ngrid\\n\\n0\\n\\n100\\n\\n200\\n\\n300\\n\\n400\\n\\n500\\n\\nModel 3Y\\nRidesharing Use\\n(solar charged)\\n\\nModel 3Y\\nPersonal Use\\n\\n(solar charged)\\n\\nModel 3Y\\nRidesharing Use\\n(grid charged)\\n\\nModel 3Y\\nPersonal Use\\n\\n(grid charged)\\n\\nAverage\\nPremium ICE\\n\\nAverage Lifecycle Emissions in China (gCO2e/mi)\\n\\nManufacturing Phase Use Phase\\n\\n0\\n\\n100\\n\\n200\\n\\n300\\n\\n400\\n\\n500\\n\\nModel 3Y\\nRidesharing Use\\n(solar charged)\\n\\nModel 3Y\\nPersonal Use\\n\\n(solar charged)\\n\\nModel 3Y\\nRidesharing Use\\n(grid charged)\\n\\nModel 3Y\\nPersonal Use\\n\\n(grid charged)\\n\\nAverage\\nPremium ICE\\n\\nManufacturing Phase Use Phase\\n\\nAverage Lifecycle Emissions in Sichuan Province (gCO2e/mi)\\n\\n\\n\\n6 3\\n\\nReducing Carbon Footprint Even Further\\nImproving Powertrain Efficiency\\n\\nMore efficiency than a Prius, performance of a Porsche\\n\\nTesla vehicles are among the most efficient EVs built to date. In the early days of Model S production, we were \\nable to achieve energy efficiency of 3.1 EPA miles / kWh. Model Y All-Wheel Drive (AWD) achieves 4.1 EPA miles \\n/ kWh, which makes it the most efficient electric SUV produced to date. The gap between Tesla AWD vehicle \\nefficiency continues to stand out compared to competitors in the same segment. While achieving the best-in-\\nclass energy efficiency, our AWD models can accelerate to 60 mph in just 4.2 seconds (4.8s for Model Y) and \\nreach a top speed of 145 mph (135 mph for Model Y). In isolation, high energy efficiency is already difficult to \\nachieve, but getting both performance and efficiency is the tricky part.\\n\\nTesla Robotaxis will be even more energy efficient\\n\\nThe energy efficiency of Tesla vehicles will continue to improve as we improve our technology and powertrain \\nefficiency. It is also reasonable to assume that our high-mileage products, such as our future Tesla Robotaxis, \\nwill be designed for maximum energy efficiency as handling, acceleration and top speed become less relevant. \\nThis will minimize cost for our customers as well as reduce the carbon footprint per mile driven.\\n\\nSource: OEM websites and other publicly available sources\\n\\nEnergy Efficiency — EPA range in miles/kWh\\nSmall SUVs (AWD)\\n\\nEnergy Efficiency — EPA range in miles/kWh\\nMid-Sized Sedans (AWD)\\n\\n0\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\nModel Y VW\\nID.4\\n\\nFord\\nMach E\\n\\nJaguar\\niPace\\n\\nAudi\\ne-tron\\n\\n0\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\nModel 3 Polestar 2 BMW\\ni4 M50\\n\\nAudi e-tron\\nSportsback\\n\\n\\n\\n6 4\\n\\n1.  Building new, better designed and more efficient factories\\n\\nBuilding a factory from the ground up with sustainability in mind can have a material impact on reducing energy \\nuse. For each component that requires less movement around the factory, and as we use fewer robots in the \\nvehicle production process, energy consumption declines.\\n\\nIn our quest for constant improvement, we build each new factory to be better and more sustainable than the \\nprevious one. For example, at Gigafactory Texas, we chose highly efficient, insulated, low emissivity windows to \\nreduce building heating and cooling demand. In addition, waste heat recovery from our compressors alone will \\noffset over 1 MW of natural gas consumption for process heating. While we have already completed substantial \\nimprovements at Gigafactory Shanghai, further improvements will continue at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg \\nand Gigafactory Texas.\\n\\nReducing Carbon Footprint Even Further\\nTesla Manufacturing Footprint: \\nCurrent Actions\\n\\nModel 3 in Fremont, CA Model 3 in Gigafactory Shanghai\\n\\nFremont Shanghai\\n\\nkWh of Energy per Vehicle Produced\\n\\n\\n\\n6 5\\n\\n2.  Covering roof space with solar panels\\n\\nAll our new factories are designed to be covered with solar panels. As of the end of 2021, we had installed solar \\npanels with a capacity of 21,405 kW, with the vast majority installed on the roofs of Gigafactory Nevada, \\nGigafactory New York and our manufacturing facilities in California. We will continue to add more capacity to \\nthese and other facilities as space allows and as is economically feasible.\\n\\n3.  Leveraging AI to make our factories more efficient\\n\\nWe are leveraging six years of sensor data from Gigafactory Nevada to train an artificial intelligence (AI) \\nprogram to safely control 195 interconnected HVAC units, accounting for 6MW of total electrical load. In its first \\nfull year of operation, we have measured significant load reduction compared to baseline usage. For such \\ncomparison, we look at actual energy usage for the HVAC system for the two modes under the same conditions \\n(operations in the factory, time of year, external temperature, etc.). AI control is expected to achieve significant \\nenergy savings for Tesla as it is scaled up to control a majority share of HVAC equipment at Gigafactory Nevada \\nas well as HVAC equipment at other Gigafactories.\\n\\nReducing Carbon Footprint Even Further\\nTesla Manufacturing Footprint: \\nCurrent Actions\\n\\n\\n\\n6 6\\n\\nReducing Carbon Footprint Even Further\\nTesla Manufacturing Footprint: \\nUpcoming Plans\\n\\nWe will not be content until all our factories are carbon neutral, and there are other projects that we are \\nworking on to further reduce emissions. In order to reduce the cost of our vehicles and batteries, we also need \\nto use less energy to produce them. Many of the projects created to achieve this goal were showcased at our \\nBattery Day presentation in September 2020.\\n\\n4.  Transitioning to in-house manufactured 4680 Tesla cells, whose production process can reduce energy \\nconsumption by more than 70%\\n\\nAt Tesla’s 2020 Battery Day, we presented a novel way that cells can be manufactured using a dry electrode \\nprocess. Current electrode production processes involve mixing liquids with cathode or anode powders and \\nusing massive machinery to coat and dry the electrode. Since this process involves large ovens, today’s cell \\nproduction consumes a lot of energy. The new dry-electrode process allows for the direct transition from a \\ncathode or anode powder to an electrode film, reducing energy consumption in the overall cell manufacturing \\nphase by more than 70% based on our latest analysis.\\n\\n5.  Utilizing renewable energy as much as possible throughout all our operations\\n\\nWe plan to shift energy consumption toward renewables as quickly as possible throughout our operations, \\nwhether it is at our factories, sales, service or delivery locations or through our Supercharger network. \\n\\n\\n\\n6 7\\n\\n0%\\n\\n20%\\n\\n40%\\n\\n60%\\n\\n80%\\n\\n100%\\n\\n0 25 50 75 100 125 150 175 200\\n\\nDistance Traveled (thousands of miles)\\n\\nTesla Model S/X Battery Capacity Retention per Distance Traveled\\n\\nStandard Deviation Retention\\n\\nOur batteries are designed to function for the entire life of the vehicle\\n\\nTesla’s battery packs are designed to outlast the vehicle. We estimate that a vehicle gets scrapped after \\napproximately 200,000 miles of usage in the U.S. and roughly 150,000 miles in Europe. Creating a battery that \\ncould last for 1,000,000 miles (4,000 charging cycles) would dramatically reduce the emissions per mile driven \\nfor high-mileage vehicles such as taxis, delivery vans or trucks.\\n\\nProducing Robotaxis is a core part of our mission. All vehicles in the world combined travel trillions of miles \\nevery year. A relatively small number of vehicles, such as taxis, delivery vans, trucks and buses account for a \\ndisproportionate amount of vehicle miles and, as a result, a disproportionate amount of emissions. A single \\nfuture Tesla vehicle with a million-mile battery could be utilized over five-times more than an average vehicle in \\nthe U.S. After being fully optimized, and even once it is scrapped, a battery can still be recycled and its \\nmaterials used in a brand-new battery.\\n\\nReducing Carbon Footprint Even Further\\nIncreasing Vehicle Utilization\\n\\nNote: Mileage is only one factor in battery capacity retention; battery age is also a major factor. Retention figures at lower mileages above likely \\nreflect the impact of age while higher mileage values, which come from high-utilization vehicles, likely reflect less influence from battery age.\\nPerformance of newer chemistries (not yet shown here) can vary and we plan to expand disclosure once we have sufficient data.\\n\\n\\n\\n6 8\\n\\nWe can make the biggest impact on GHG emissions by selling as many of our products as possible. \\nUndoubtedly, the use-phase of our products avoids more lifetime emissions than either our operations or our \\nsupply chain could. However, in support of our mission, we track and try to minimize emissions that result from \\nour full value chain, including our supply chain, manufacturing processes as well as our sales, service and \\ndelivery activities.\\n\\nIn 2021, we began measuring our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions considering the principles and guidance \\nof the GHG Protocol. We used the operational control approach methodology – accounting for GHG emissions \\nfrom operations under our control. For detailed information on the scope of our calculations, please see page \\n139-142 of this report.\\n\\nWhile our total Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions may increase on an absolute basis in the near term as we \\ncontinue to open new factories, our goal is to reduce the emissions intensity from production as we push the \\nboundaries of sustainable manufacturing and improve the efficiency of our operations. As part of our \\ncommitment to reducing our overall emissions in the long term we signed up for the Science-Based Target \\nInitiative (SBTi) in 2021.\\n\\nGHG Emissions\\nScope 1, 2 and 3\\n\\nMetric Unit of Measure Manufacturing SSD1 Other2 TOTAL\\n\\nScope 1 GHG emissions tCO2e 124,000 31,000 30,000 185,000*\\n\\nScope 2 GHG emissions \\n(location-based) tCO2e 342,000 35,000 26,000 403,000*\\n\\nScope 3 | Category 11: \\nUse of Sold Products \\n\\n(EV charging)\\ntCO2e 1,954,000 \\n\\n1 SSD = Sales, Service & Delivery\\n2 Other includes sites that conduct research & development, administration, energy product warehousing and deployment, and other mixed-used \\nwarehousing.\\n*PwC performed an attest review engagement on this metric.

Most companies lack primary data as it relates to their supply chain, product use and so on. Therefore, \\nmost Scope 3 GHG emissions reporting is done using lofty assumptions as well as estimates from databases –\\nthis can lead to figures that are magnitudes off from the actual impact. Tesla has begun to measure the two \\nlargest categories within our Scope 3 emissions: those from use of product and our supply chain.\\n\\nUse of product emissions\\n\\nTesla has access to primary data from our over two million vehicles on the road and our fleet of solar and \\nstorage products — we can calculate our emissions at a much higher level of accuracy than most manufactures \\nand can therefore develop emissions reduction solutions to match. This also means that we can calculate our use \\nof product emissions year on year — we do not have to estimate emissions over the lifetime of the vehicle \\nbecause we have primary data.\\n\\nSupply chain emissions\\n\\nPrioritizing our supply chain is crucial and we have a lot of work to do to incentivize suppliers to provide energy \\nand emissions data for us to report on. We have already started to identify which materials and processes in our \\nsupply chain are key emitters so we can prioritize engagement and projects to address these emissions — see \\nthe Supply Chain section for more detail.\\n\\nThe good thing for us is that Tesla’s high level of vertical integration and our direct sourcing relationships mean \\nwe are positioned to manage upstream emissions better than most.\\n\\n100% Renewable Supercharger network\\n\\nEfficiency of an ICE vehicle does not improve throughout its lifetime. EVs will get cleaner over their lifetime as \\nthe grid becomes greener. We will continue to look for ways to enable our customers to further reduce their \\nemissions beyond our vehicles — through solar and storage products and software to help differentiate when the \\ngrid is greener and pulling more renewable energy like solar or wind.\\n\\nThe global Supercharger network was 100% renewable in 2021, achieved through a combination of onsite \\nresources and annual renewable matching. Additionally, all home charging in California was 100% renewable \\nthrough annual renewable matching. Therefore, the only emissions from the use of Tesla vehicles were a result of \\nhome charging outside of California and use of third-party charging networks.\\n\\nGHG Emissions\\nScope 3 Emissions \\n\\n\\n\\n7 0\\n\\nPollution from burning fossil fuels leads to eight million premature deaths globally each year \\n\\nAccording to recently published research in Environmental Research by Harvard University, in collaboration with \\nthe University of Birmingham, the University of Leicester and University College London, air pollution causes \\nover eight million premature deaths annually. That is double the previous estimate of deaths from the negative \\neffects of fine-particle pollution and would account for one-in-five premature deaths worldwide. This is a major \\nadvantage of EVs that is often forgotten about as the overall EV debate tends to focus on greenhouse gases. \\nEVs are not just about the future of our planet, but very much about addressing preventable deaths today.\\n\\nWhile air-quality is often categorized as a problem in developing countries, Nitrogen oxide (NOx) and other \\nPM2.5 particulates* cause significant issues in developed countries as well. In Europe alone, almost 800,000 \\npeople die prematurely every year due to pollution-related illnesses.

Electrifying the \\nheavy-duty truck segment is an essential part of transitioning the world to sustainable energy.\\n\\nPayload equal to a diesel truck\\n\\nWith both the U.S. and E.U. having approved higher weight allowances for electric heavy-duty trucks, we expect \\nthe payload to be at least as high as it would be for a diesel truck. In the E.U., electric semi trucks are allowed to \\nbe 2 tons (~4,400 pounds) heavier than diesel equivalents, and in the U.S. the allowance is 0.9 tons (2,000 \\npounds). When fully loaded, the Tesla Semi should be able to achieve over 500 miles of range, achieved through \\naerodynamics and highly efficient motors. This truck will be able to reach an efficiency of over 0.5 miles per \\nkWh.\\n\\nWhile most heavy trucking journeys are shorter than 500 miles, we want long-distance hauling to also be \\nsustainable. We are in the process of developing a Semi charger network at trucking rest stops across the U.S. \\nand Europe, where each Tesla Semi could top up their range.\\n\\nTesla Semi is critical to our mission to accelerate the world’s \\ntransition to sustainable energy. Right now, cell availability is \\nthe limiting factor for production – a Tesla Semi requires \\nmultiple times more cells than a passenger vehicle. \\n\\n\\n\\n7 2\\n\\nWaste Generated Per Vehicle Manufactured As we build more efficient factories, our waste per vehicle decreases\\n\\nBuilding localized factories both makes sense economically and reduces waste. First, because the automotive \\nsupply chain doesn’t have a strong presence on the West Coast of the U.S., many components need to be \\nshipped from long distances, requiring excessive packaging and creating more waste than necessary.\\n\\nSecond, modern factories are better designed for material flow. Trailer entry points surround the whole factory, \\nwhich means that components can be offloaded precisely at the part of the factory where they are needed. Less \\nmaterial flow results in less waste, because a shorter journey requires less protective packaging. The chart \\nbelow shows that waste generation per vehicle at Gigafactory Shanghai is less than half of what it is in the U.S. \\nWe are expecting our upcoming factories such as Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas to \\ncontinue the same trend.\\n\\nAny materials that are possible to recycle, we recycle\\n\\nThe vast majority of generated waste, such as paper, plastics and metals, is recyclable. At Gigafactory Shanghai, \\nfor example, just 7% of total waste generated in 2021 was not recyclable.\\n\\nWe push for innovative approaches to reducing waste, which includes reduction of non-recyclable materials in \\nthe first place, learning from local factories and deploying improvements globally or working with our logistics \\nteam to minimize shipments and packaging per vehicle.\\n\\n• Global Vehicle Manufacturing = all major factories dedicated to vehicle manufacturing, including the Fremont Factory and supporting facilities, Gigafactory Nevada and \\nGigafactory Shanghai.\\n\\n• Legacy Manufacturing Sites = Gigafactory Nevada, Fremont Factory and supporting facilities.\\n• New Manufacturing Sites = Gigafactory Shanghai.\\n\\n0\\n\\n200\\n\\n400\\n\\n600\\n\\nGlobal Vehicle Manufacturing Legacy Manufacturing Sites New Manufacturing Sites\\n\\nWaste Generated in Vehicle Manufacturing (2021; kg/vehicle)\\n\\nWaste Diverted from Disposal (Recycled) Waste Directed to Disposal\\n\\n\\n\\n7 3\\n\\nWater Used Per Vehicle Manufactured\\nCurrent State\\n\\nWe currently use less water per vehicle than almost any ICE carmaker\\n\\nThere is a misconception that producing an EV requires more water than producing an ICE vehicle. Our data \\nshows this is not the case. While each automaker may draw their boundaries slightly differently (depending on \\nhow vertically integrated they are), according to the latest publicly available figures, Tesla withdrew less water \\nat facilities dedicated to vehicle manufacturing per vehicle produced than the majority of established \\ncarmakers. Furthermore, the efficient manufacturing design we are implementing at our new factories in Texas \\nand Berlin-Brandenburg will result in further reductions in our water usage per vehicle. Our goal is to have \\nindustry-leading low water usage per vehicle, even when accounting for cell manufacturing. The below chart \\nincludes our latest estimates for water usage per vehicle at those facilities.\\n\\nWater usage and power generation\\n\\nWhile many recognize the impact that power generation has on GHG emissions, its impact on water \\nconsumption is less appreciated. Power generation is one of the leading causes of water withdrawal in the U.S., \\nas water for thermoelectric power is used to generate electricity with steam-driven turbine generators and to \\ncool power-producing equipment. This means that every kilowatt-hour (kWh) of clean solar energy produced \\nnot only lowers GHG emissions, but also lowers water consumption.\\n\\n*Latest estimate for water consumption based on factory design. Actual production figures will not be known until factories are ramped to full production \\nspeed.\\n\\n0\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\nGF Berlin\\n(est.)*\\n\\nBMW GF Texas\\n(est.)*\\n\\nTesla\\n(2021)\\n\\nFord Industry\\nAvg.\\n\\nToyota VW Group GM Daimler\\n(cars)\\n\\nStellantis\\n\\nWater Withdrawal Intensity in Vehicle Manufacturing (m3/vehicle)\\n\\nVehicle Manufacturing Cell Manufacturing\\n\\n\\n\\n74\\n\\nTesla factories are setting a new standard of water use per vehicle\\n\\nWater is becoming increasingly scarce as the climate changes. That is why we are reducing our water usage \\nthroughout our operations as much as possible. We have prioritized direct use in manufacturing and will \\ncontinue to explore the rest of our impact throughout the supply chain and in sales, service and delivery.\\n\\nThe “cooling tower makeup” is the single biggest contributor to water usage in any car factory after paint \\noperations. As water that cools machinery evaporates, it needs to be topped up regularly. The total cooling \\ntower makeup could be offset entirely by non-potable sources such as rainwater or wastewater. These are some \\nof the initiatives we are taking at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and/or Gigafactory Texas in order to reduce \\nwater consumption per complete vehicle (including cells).\\n\\n1. Water intensive process optimization: We are constantly looking into reducing water consumption by \\noptimizing or eliminating water intensive production processes across our operations. At Gigafactory Berlin-\\nBrandenburg, we use hybrid cooling towers, have eliminated quench tanks in casting and introduced cascade \\nrinsing systems in the paint shop and battery can wash process for cell manufacturing.\\n\\n2. Rainwater and condensate harvesting and reuse: We are planning to capture at least 25% of roof runoff (1 \\nmillion square feet) to a central underground storage system within Gigafactory Texas. Rainwater will be \\nrecycled for use in the cooling of manufacturing equipment. In an average year, such systems should save an \\nestimated 7.5 million gallons of potable city water. Additionally, as hot, humid outdoor air is conditioned, water \\ncondenses out of the air. Typically, this condensate is discarded as wastewater. At Gigafactory Texas, we reuse \\nthis condensate in our cooling towers and process water systems to offset incoming site water.\\n\\n3. Reclaimed and recycled water (wastewater reuse): Using local treated wastewater could result in offsetting \\nthe entire annual cooling tower makeup water demand with non-drinkable uses. At Gigafactory Texas, this could \\nresult in an estimated 40 million gallons of potable city water conserved annually. Reclaimed water is available \\nand under investigation for use at both Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg.\\n\\nWater Used Per Vehicle Manufactured\\nInitiatives at Our Factories\\n\\n\\n\\n7 5\\n\\n0\\n\\n200,000\\n\\n400,000\\n\\n600,000\\n\\n800,000\\n\\n1,000,000\\n\\nTesla VW\\nGroup\\n\\nBYD Hyundai\\nMotor\\n\\nR-N-M\\nAlliance\\n\\nStellantis BMW\\nGroup\\n\\nDaimler Ford GM Toyota\\nMotor\\nCorp.\\n\\nJaguar\\nLand\\nRover\\n(Tata)\\n\\nElectric Vehicles Produced \\n2017\\n2018\\n2019\\n2020\\n2021\\n\\nEmissions credit systems around the world are designed to economically benefit companies with non-polluting \\nproducts by allowing them to sell their credits to polluting companies. In order to meet various countries’ \\nemission targets and avoid government fines, polluting companies pay non-polluting companies through credit \\npurchases. The goal of this system is for every OEM to be incentivized to reduce emissions and themselves \\nbecome non-polluting by selling more of their own manufactured EVs instead of paying another company for \\ntheir non-polluting credits. \\n\\nEmissions credit revenue is used for EV capacity expansion, which in turn displaces ICEs\\n\\nIn 2021, we generated almost $1.5 billion in revenue selling zero-emission regulatory credits to other OEMs. \\nProceeds from such sales will go towards building new factories to produce EVs that will continue to displace \\nICE vehicles. While it is common practice today for ICE vehicle OEMs to purchase regulatory credits from other \\ncompanies (such as Tesla) to offset their total GHG emissions, it is not a sustainable strategy. In order to meet \\nincreasingly strict regulatory requirements across the world, OEMs will be forced to develop truly competitive \\nEVs.\\n\\nEV sales by all carmakers need to accelerate, taking market share from ICEs\\n\\nIn 2021, Tesla delivered almost 1 million EVs globally.

In order to \\nconvince consumers to buy our products, they need to be better in every way – performance, cost of ownership, \\nsafety, fun and more. We want to make products that people love.\\n\\nModel 3 is the first EV to be priced on-par with ICE vehicle equivalents\\n\\nModel 3 is the first EV in history priced competitively with its gas-powered equivalents, even before taking into \\nconsideration any regional subsidies and lower running costs. Unfortunately, most other EVs on the market \\ntoday are often priced at over a $10,000 premium compared to their direct ICE vehicle equivalents.\\n\\nThere doesn’t need to be a tradeoff between sustainability, performance and affordability\\n\\nTesla’s ability to achieve our mission rests first and foremost on our products. We are not just trying to build the \\nbest electric cars, we are striving to build the best cars, period. Our focus from the beginning has been to \\ndevelop products that are not only sustainable, but also superior to fossil-fuel alternatives in every way. Many \\nincorrectly believe that choosing sustainable products requires consumers to compromise on price or \\nperformance, but Tesla vehicles combine performance, safety, efficiency and competitive prices. Similarly, \\nTesla’s energy generation and storage products power both urban and remote communities with reliable, \\naffordable energy.\\n\\n$0\\n\\n$10,000\\n\\n$20,000\\n\\n$30,000\\n\\n$40,000\\n\\n$50,000\\n\\nAudi A4 BMW 3 Series Mercedes C-Class* Model 3 RWD\\n\\nStarting Price of Mid-Sized Premium Sedans \\n(before subsidies or dealer incentives)\\n\\n\\n\\n7 8\\n\\nOver 5 years of average driving, the ownership costs of a Tesla Model 3 are closer to a Camry than a 3 Series\\n\\nThe accessibility of our products is fundamental to our mission. While the “sticker price” of Model 3 is similar to \\nan equivalent BMW or Audi, the sticker price of a vehicle itself is only one of many cost items that need to be \\nconsidered. The lifetime running costs of EVs are lower than those of ICE vehicles due to lower maintenance \\ncosts, cheap electricity and high residual value of used Tesla vehicles, the latter of which has remained \\nexceptionally strong since our initial launch. As a result, Tesla Model 3 has a base price similar to BMW 3 Series, \\nbut the total cost of ownership per mile is closer to America’s best-selling sedan, the Toyota Camry*.\\n\\nCost data is based on data collected from our fleet\\n\\nThe advantage of having a fleet of vehicles that is constantly online is the ability to analyze real-world data \\nrather than only being able to use estimates. We have an extensive database of Model 3 residual values and cost \\nof repairs, maintenance, energy use, etc.  Additionally, the insurance cost for the Model 3 RWD below is based on \\nthe projected median insurance rate in the U.S. for Tesla Model 3 drivers. Our analysis shows that over five years \\nand 60,000 miles, running a Model 3 RWD costs 63 cents per mile.\\n\\nNotably, running costs such as fuel (electricity or gasoline), maintenance, tires and repairs for Model 3 should \\ncost just over half of a mass-market ICE vehicle such as a Toyota Camry.\\n\\n*Based on model year 2021 vehicles.

Our data shows \\nthat Tesla vehicles are being driven more than average vehicles in the U.S., suggesting that they are generally \\nbeing used as a customer’s primary vehicle. We fundamentally believe that you shouldn’t have to choose \\nbetween price, quality, usability and sustainability. An EV should be the best vehicle in every way, so consumers \\ndon’t ever need to use ICE vehicles.\\n\\nThe longer the range, the higher the usage\\n\\nThere is a clear relationship between range, how often an EV is utilized and whether it is a primary-use vehicle. \\nThe more confident owners are that their EV can be used for commuting, errands and long road trips, the less \\nthey will feel they need to supplement their EV with an ICE vehicle. Surveys consistently indicate that the real or \\nperceived lack of EV range is the key reason why many people do not consider replacing their ICE vehicle with \\nan EV.\\n\\n0 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,000 10,000 12,000\\n\\nAvg.

To ensure we replace as many ICE vehicles \\nwith EVs as possible, we have been focused on increasing the range of Tesla vehicles. While most personal \\nvehicle journeys are relatively short, and thus drivable on a single charge, consumers do not buy cars that can \\nmeet most of their driving needs; they buy a car that meets all their driving needs.\\n\\nThe longer the range, the lower the Supercharger use\\n\\nSince its introduction in 2012, we have increased the range of the Model S by over 50%: from 265 miles to 405 \\nmiles of range for the long-range version. Our focus on energy efficiency — achieving superior range from the \\nsame size battery — has allowed to us continue to increase range while keeping the battery size relatively \\nstable. Our data shows that the longer the range of our vehicles, the less Supercharging Tesla customers do. \\nAfter all, day trips of over 400 miles are quite rare.\\n\\nSuper-fast charging: V3 Superchargers can increase range by up to 200 miles in just 15 minutes\\n\\nAround 300 miles of range at highway speeds is equal to roughly four hours of driving. At that stage, drivers \\nare often likely to take a break. We want to make sure that such a break can be relatively short before \\ncontinuing the journey. Our latest generation of Superchargers can recover up to 200 miles of range in just 15 \\nminutes of charging, long enough for a quick break and snack.\\n\\nSubstantial coverage and 99.96% reliability\\n\\nWe’re aware that the chart showing Supercharger uptime looks silly, but that’s kind of the point. While coverage \\nis important, uptime is essential. Few things are as frustrating as arriving to a charging station with a near-\\nempty battery, realizing that none of the charging plugs are working. In 2021 alone, we opened 912 new \\nSupercharger locations around the world for a total of nearly 3,500 charging locations with over 31,000 plugs. \\n\\n1Uptime of Supercharger sites reflects the average percentage of sites globally that had at least 50% daily capacity functional for the year.\\n\\n99.0%\\n\\n99.5%\\n\\n100.0%\\n\\n2018 2019 2020 2021\\n\\nUptime of Supercharger Sites1\\n\\nVehicle Usage\\nLong-Distance Travel\\n\\n\\n\\n8 1\\n\\nSafety Is Our Top Design Priority \\n\\nAt Tesla, safety features are not optional.

Through our Tesla Insurance program, we do just this \\nby providing real time feedback to customers and incentives for safe driving such as reductions in monthly \\ninsurance premiums.\\n\\nCustomers who choose to be a part of this program receive a Safety ScoreBeta. This score changes based on \\ndriving behavior and the insurance premium changes with it. Instead of determining a driver’s insurance \\npremiums from demographic information (gender, age, education, or marital status) and financial history (credit \\nscore), our algorithm calculates Safety ScoreBeta based on actual driver behavior. The behaviors we monitor are: \\n\\n• Forward Collision Warnings\\n\\n• Hard Braking\\n\\n• Aggressive Turning\\n\\n• Unsafe Following (Tailgating) \\n\\n• Forced Autopilot Disengagement  \\n\\nOur data show a lower rate of collision for the cohort of customers who have enabled Safety ScoreBeta.  As the \\nvehicle’s Safety ScoreBeta increases, the number of collisions per mile decreases and insurance premiums reduce.\\n\\nVehicle Safety\\nDriver Behavior\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n8 3\\n\\nOur commitment to safety is why all Tesla vehicles built since October 2016 come with a suite of external \\ncameras, additional sensors and onboard computing that enable advanced safety features like Automatic \\nEmergency Braking, Lane Departure Warning, Forward and Side Collision Warning, Obstacle-Aware \\nAcceleration, blind spot warnings and more — all of which continue to improve over time through software \\nupdates. We recently introduced active safety features that go beyond the norm:\\n\\nTraffic Light & Stop Sign Warning\\n\\nWhen a driver doesn’t notice a red light or a stop sign, our cars will notice that vehicle’s speed is too high. \\nThanks to our eight-camera system, each vehicle can recognize a traffic light that is specific to vehicle’s \\ntrajectory as well as a stop sign. A loud warning is triggered to alert the driver.\\n\\nPedal Misapplication Mitigation (accelerator pressed inadvertently)\\n\\nPressing the accelerator pedal when the circumstances indicate you should be pressing the brake instead, like \\nwhen pulling into a parking space, is relatively common no matter what vehicle you're in. However, if you are in \\na Tesla, when our cameras recognize an object in front of the car, “Pedal Misapplication Mitigation” system cuts \\ntorque from the electric motor to prevent a collision if you happen to press hard on the accelerator. This \\ntechnology has prevented or mitigated hundreds of collisions every month.\\n\\nActive avoidance of lane departure or a blind-spot collision\\n\\nIf a driver is changing into a lane while a vehicle in the blind spot is entering the same lane, or if our vehicle \\nstarts departing its lane without an indicator, our vehicles will sound a warning and assist the steering to avoid a \\ncollision.\\n\\nVehicle Safety\\nCrash Avoidance\\n\\n\\n\\n8 4\\n\\nModel X Model 3 Model Y\\n\\nEuro NCAP* 94% 94% Scheduled for 2022\\n\\nANCAP* (Australasian New Car Assessment Program) 94% 94% Scheduled for 2022\\n\\nIIHS (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety) Superior Superior\\n\\nVehicle Safety\\nSafety Assist Ratings\\n\\nNot all Active Safety systems are created equal\\n\\nMany people assume that AEB (Automatic Emergency Breaking) – a system that most new vehicles are \\nequipped with – works equally well with all vehicles. That’s not the case. The range of sensors, compute power \\nand quality of software in the system can vary dramatically. Our active safety features are powered by eight \\ncameras, a neural-net computer and learnings from our fleet of over two million cars. \\n\\nAfter the introduction of Tesla Vision (a vision-only system that excludes radar), our active safety ratings with \\nIIHS improved.

Our \\nalgorithm uses vehicle sensor data and, within tens of milli-seconds of impact, determines what type of impact \\nhas occurred and triggers the seatbelt pretensioners and airbags to respond in the most optimal way down to \\nthe millimeter and mile per hour. Tesla engineers are also in the final stages of evaluating a system which uses \\nAutopilot to identify when a crash is imminent.

Tesla is also sharing \\ndata and statistics collected by our vehicles with select regulatory bodies and external research organizations —\\nin an anonymized fashion or with consent and in accordance with local data privacy laws — giving them access \\nto an unprecedented opportunity to understand crashes in the real world. This access to data will accelerate \\nimpact safety research, driving change across the safety industry and improved safety outcomes for all vehicles \\nto protect lives.\\n\\nPost-Crash Data Analysis\\n\\nAfter we send new software to the fleet, we wait for new data to come through to understand the efficacy of \\nthe system once it is deployed in the real world. Since deployment of our ‘offzone’ side algorithm (data-driven \\nsafety), we learned that of the total vehicles that had their airbags deployed, 15% of those deployed due to our \\nnew algorithm in these new modes. This confirms our expectations and highlights how effective fleet-based \\nlearnings and rapid deployment of novel solutions can be. \\n\\nWhy Airbags Sometimes Don’t Deploy\\n\\nIn a fairly common “small overlap” collision as the one shown below, front sensors are unlikely to pick up a side \\ncollision, as they are usually designed to detect a frontal collision. And side sensors are usually too close to a \\ndriver window to detect a collision far in the front. We designed our sensors and their positions in a way that \\nthey can pick up nearly every type of collision and deploy airbags if necessary. \\n\\nVehicle Safety\\nData-Driven Safety\\n\\nWatch video on Data-Driven Safety\\n\\nRestraints Deployments Since Introducing Data-Driven Algorithm\\n\\nRegular restraint deployment\\n\\nRestraints deployment not covered by regulation\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KR2N_Q8ep8\\n\\n\\n8 8\\n\\nSafety starts with our clean sheet design\\n\\nImproving occupant safety has always been key to our mission.

This is likely a result of \\nchasing clicks, rather than the prevalence of EV-related fires compared to ICE vehicle-related fires. The reality is, \\nwhen compared to Tesla vehicles, ICE vehicles catch fire at a vastly higher rate. According to the latest available \\ndata, in 2020, there were almost 173,000 vehicle fires in the U.S. alone.  \\n\\nFrom 2012 to 2021, there has been approximately five Tesla vehicle fires for every billion miles traveled. By \\ncomparison, data from the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and U.S. Department of Transportation \\nshow that in the U.S. there are 53 vehicle fires for every billion miles travelled.  \\n\\nIn order to provide an apt comparison to NFPA data, Tesla’s data set includes instances of vehicle fires caused \\nby structure fires, arson and other reasons unrelated to the vehicle, which account for some of the Tesla vehicle \\nfires over this time period.\\n\\nWe continue to improve safety\\n\\nWe continue to improve our battery chemistry, cell structure, battery pack structure and vehicle passive safety \\nin order to decrease fire risk to as close to zero as possible. As Tesla’s vehicle technology continues to improve, \\nfires will be even less likely for our EVs.\\n\\nTesla has partnered with European and Australasian NCAPs to provide free mobile app-based emergency \\nresponse documentation for quick access to Tesla vehicle specific models.

If installing Megapack makes economic sense, \\nthere is no reason not to install one. A single Megapack has on average 3,000 kWh worth of battery storage \\ncapacity, and given its scalability, enables projects over 1,000,000 kWh. Tesla Energy continues to be \\ndependent on the global supply chain, including cell supply. In 2021, in order to meet demand that is well in \\nexcess of supply for energy storage products, Tesla began building a new production facility capable of \\nproducing 40,000,000 kWh of energy storage per year.\\n\\nEnergy Storage Enables 100% Renewables Penetration\\n\\n120\\n\\n100\\n\\n80\\n\\n60\\n\\n40\\n\\n20\\n\\n0\\n\\nG\\nW\\n\\nTuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday SundayMonday\\n\\n\\n\\n9 2\\n\\nPairing energy storage with renewables enables cost-effective decarbonization of the grid\\n\\nThe best way to avoid blackouts is to reduce your reliance on the grid. Tesla is a one-stop shop for taking our \\ncustomers off-grid by covering a large variety of their needs. In 2021, Tesla sold 4 GWh worth of energy storage \\nproducts, more than 15% of the 25 GWh global market*. Some of these projects were massive deployments, \\nincluding a 371 MWh installation in California and a 497 MWh installation in Victoria, Australia. In order to switch \\nglobal energy usage to renewable sources, we estimate that global annual battery storage production will need \\nto increase to ~10,000 GWh.\\n\\nResidential customers: Solar Roof, solar panels and Powerwall\\n\\nAnyone can dramatically reduce their carbon footprint by installing Solar Roof or solar panels with Powerwall. \\nIn theory, all U.S. domestic electricity needs, as well as vehicle transportation needs, could be met by sunlight \\nalone. Naturally, installation of such a system needs to make financial sense for the customer. In Massachusetts, \\nfor example, we estimate that an average solar and storage system pays for itself with energy cost savings \\nwithin approximately 10 years. As the cost of these products continues to decline, more customers will be \\nwilling to switch to solar and storage purely due to lower overall cost.\\n\\nTesla Energy Storage Deployments (GWh)\\n\\n0.0\\n\\n0.5\\n\\n1.0\\n\\n1.5\\n\\n2.0\\n\\n2.5\\n\\n3.0\\n\\n3.5\\n\\n4.0\\n\\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\\n\\nSolar + Storage Product\\nPotential For Growth\\n\\n*Source: S&P Global\\n\\n\\n\\n9 3\\n\\nGrid outages are becoming more common\\n\\nElectrical disturbances in the U.S. are becoming more common, predominantly due to weather and natural \\ndisasters.

Tesla creates our products \\nfrom many different materials and components, some of which we purchase from our direct (Tier 1) suppliers. \\nMany of our Tier 1 suppliers do not purchase all their raw materials directly, rather they get them from their \\nsuppliers and sub-suppliers around the world through a complex supply chain. Though we believe that battery \\nrecycling will play a critical role in supplying a portion of these materials to enable a closed loop supply chain, \\nwe recognize that global battery cell production will continue to rely heavily on primary, mined materials to \\nmeet the growing demand for our products.\\n\\nIn line with our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy, Tesla is committed to ensuring \\nthat companies in our supply chain respect human rights and protect the environment. Our goal is that where \\nTesla’s supply chain touches, local conditions for stakeholders continuously improve as a result of our \\npurchases. Our responsible sourcing strategy has the following objectives:\\n\\n1. Increase the share of materials we source directly from suppliers, and those closer to our factories \\n(supply chain localization); and  \\n\\n2. Continue to source globally, to contribute to the improvement of local conditions in our sourcing \\ncommunities. \\n\\nMapping GHG emissions in the battery supply chain is one of our top priorities\\n\\nUpstream GHG emissions from manufacturing an EV battery – from raw material extraction through refining and \\ntransportation of materials – can be meaningful. We estimate that these specific activities cause up to ~80% of \\nthe total emissions of a Model 3 battery pack, with the largest contributors at the chemical processing stage. \\nOur battery supply chain GHG emissions hotspot analysis – an industry first – is on page 104 of this report.\\n\\nSupply Chain \\nIntroduction\\n\\n~12 ton of rock mined Produce a battery pack Produce a battery pack Produce a battery pack\\n\\nRecycle Recycle RecycleRefine\\n\\nRefined electrode material\\n\\n\\n\\n9 6\\n\\nExtracting raw \\nmaterials\\n\\nA common question we receive is: “What happens to Tesla battery packs once they reach the end of their life?” \\nAn important distinction between fossil fuels and lithium-ion batteries as an energy source is that while fossil \\nfuels are extracted and used once, the materials in a lithium-ion battery are recyclable. When petroleum is \\npumped out of the ground, chemically refined and then burned, it releases toxic emissions into the atmosphere \\nthat are not recoverable for reuse. Battery materials, in contrast, are refined and put into a cell and will remain in \\nthe cell at the end of their life when they can be recycled to recover valuable materials for reuse, repeatedly.\\n\\nLonger battery longevity is the most sustainable option\\n\\nBattery pack life extension is the superior option to recycling for both environmental and business reasons. \\nBefore decommissioning and recycling a consumer battery pack, Tesla does everything it can to extend the \\nuseful life of each pack, including sending out over-the-air software updates to Tesla vehicles to improve battery \\nefficiency when our engineers find new ways to do so. In addition, any battery that is no longer meeting a \\ncustomer’s needs can be serviced at a Tesla Service Center.\\n\\nEvery battery used in R&D or returned from the field that cannot be re-manufactured is recycled\\n\\nTesla batteries, including the battery packs in our vehicles and our energy storage products, are made to last \\nmany years, and therefore, we have received a limited number of them back from the field. Most batteries that \\nTesla recycles today are pre-consumer, coming to us through R&D and quality control. None of our scrapped \\nlithium-ion batteries go to landfills and 100% are recycled. Furthermore, Tesla has an established internal \\necosystem to re-manufacture batteries coming from the field to our Service Centers. We actively implement \\ncircular economy principles and consider all other options before opting for battery recycling.\\n\\nThe small number of post-consumer batteries that we receive are primarily generated from our fleet of vehicles \\non the road, predominantly from taxi-like vehicles. Since we have only been producing Model S (our oldest \\nmodel) for approximately ten years, and our energy storage products for even less time, it will likely be some \\ntime before we start receiving back vehicle batteries in larger volumes.\\n\\nSupply Chain \\nRecycling\\n\\n\\n\\n9 7\\n\\nWhile Tesla works with third-party recyclers, we also recycle in-house\\n\\nIn 2020, Tesla successfully installed the first phase of our cell recycling facility at Gigafactory Nevada for in-\\nhouse processing of both battery manufacturing scrap and end-of-life batteries. While Tesla has worked for \\nyears with third-party battery recyclers to ensure our batteries do not end up in a landfill, we understand the \\nimportance of also building recycling capacity in-house to supplement these relationships. On-site recycling \\nbrings us one step closer to closing the loop on materials generation, allowing for raw material transfer straight \\nto our nickel and cobalt suppliers. The facility unlocks the cycle of innovation for battery recycling at scale, \\nallowing Tesla to rapidly improve current designs through operational learnings and to perform process testing \\nof R&D products. By the end of 2021, this facility achieved a production rate of over 50 tons of recycled material \\nper week.\\n\\nEvery Tesla battery factory will recycle batteries on-site\\n\\nAs the manufacturer of our in-house cell program, we are best positioned to recycle our products efficiently to \\nmaximize key battery material recovery. With the implementation of in-house cell manufacturing at Gigafactory \\nBerlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas, we expect substantial increases in manufacturing scrap globally. We \\nintend to tailor recycling solutions to each location and thereby re-introduce valuable materials back into our \\nmanufacturing process. Our goal is to develop a safe recycling process with high recovery rates, low costs and \\nlow environmental impact. From an economic perspective, we expect to recognize significant savings over the \\nlong term as the costs associated with large-scale battery material recovery and recycling will be far lower than \\npurchasing additional raw materials for cell manufacturing.\\n\\nGlobal annual amount of lithium-ion battery metals sent for \\nrecycling\\n\\n1,500\\nTons of Nickel\\n\\n300\\nTons of Copper\\n\\n200\\nTons of Cobalt\\n\\nA closed-loop battery recycling process presents a \\ncompelling solution to move energy supply away from the \\nfossil-fuel based practice of take, make and burn, to a more \\ncircular model of recycling end-of-life batteries for reuse over \\nand over again.\\n\\nSupply Chain \\nRecycling\\n\\n\\n\\n9 8\\n\\nWe have high expectations for our suppliers\\n\\nTesla is committed to ensuring that our suppliers operate responsibly. We do this by proactively identifying and \\naddressing potential risks in our supply chains. The Tesla Supplier Code of Conduct, Human Rights Policy and \\nResponsible Materials Policy outline Tesla’s expectations for suppliers. \\n\\nWe established a responsible sourcing program based on international best practices \\n\\nOur responsible sourcing program is based on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Mineral \\nSupply Chains. Tesla collects data from its supply chain (including through audits), translates this data into on-\\nthe-ground actions and discloses the outcomes in our annual Impact Report.\\n\\nThe next sections will detail how we undertake each of the five steps laid out above, starting with our \\nmanagement system approach.\\n\\nDirect Sourcing from Upstream Companies \\n\\nPositive Local Impact \\n\\nEstablish \\nDue Diligence \\nManagement \\n\\nSystem\\n\\nDisclosure in the \\nImpact Report \\n\\nCollect and \\ninvestigate Supply \\n\\nChain Environmental \\nand Social Data\\n\\nRisk Mitigation \\nand Improvement \\n\\nof Conditions\\n\\nCollaboration with \\nIndustry Initiatives\\n\\nSupply Chain \\nAlignment with Best Practices\\n\\n\\n\\n9 9\\n\\nPrioritization of cobalt, lithium and nickel\\n\\nGiven their unique significance to the success of EVs and energy storage, Tesla has a dedicated responsible \\nsourcing program for three priority minerals in the battery supply chain: cobalt, nickel and lithium. We prioritize \\nthese raw materials for the following reasons:\\n\\n1. Commercial importance: Cobalt, lithium and nickel are the key raw materials used in cathode production, \\nrepresent about a third of the total costs of a battery cell and play an essential function in improving vehicle \\nrange and safety performance.\\n\\n2. Potential environmental and social impact and scrutiny: Cobalt, lithium and nickel are also ‘minerals’ – in that \\nthey are raw materials that are produced through different methods of mining around the world, often \\nconcentrated in countries that face socio-economic and environmental challenges. As known global reserves \\nare depleted, these minerals are becoming increasingly scarce, and companies look to access resources in \\nmore remote and challenging locations to meet global demand. Cobalt, lithium and nickel are also classified \\nas critical minerals by the United States, European Union and Canadian governments because they are \\nessential in enabling a transition away from fossil fuels to a low-carbon economy. As a result, the impact of \\nmining activity on the environment and local communities lends itself to greater environmental and social \\nscrutiny from civil society, policymakers and investors.\\n\\nMining has an important role to play in the transition to sustainable energy and we engage with suppliers to \\nensure mining is done in a responsible way. This is one of the reasons Tesla joined the Initiative for Responsible \\nMining Assurance (IRMA) and uses the IRMA Standard as well as other internationally recognized responsible \\nmining standards in our due diligence.\\n\\nBattery Supply Chain\\n#1 The Tesla Approach\\n\\n\\n\\n1 0 0\\n\\nThe unique Tesla approach: Going directly to the source\\n\\nThe implementation of an OECD-aligned approach for cobalt, nickel and lithium is underpinned by the following \\ntwo pillars:\\n\\n1. Direct sourcing from mining companies: While cobalt, nickel and lithium go through multiple processing \\nsteps by different companies, some of the more important environmental and social risks in this supply chain \\nare present at mine sites. Direct sourcing from mining companies allows Tesla to engage directly in local \\ncontexts instead of having to rely on multiple midstream companies that typically sit between EV makers \\nand mining. It also enables more transparent and traceable supply chains and better environmental and \\nsocial data. In 2021, Tesla procured >95% of lithium hydroxide, >50% of cobalt and >30% of nickel for nickel-\\ncontaining (NCA and NCM) cells directly from nine mining and chemicals companies. All nine binding \\ncontracts include environmental and social requirements. As Tesla’s battery supply chain continues to scale, \\nTesla expects the proportion of directly sourced minerals to increase.\\n\\n2. Direct local engagement: Building on direct supplier engagement, Tesla seeks to contribute to the \\ncontinuous improvement of conditions in communities affected by operations in Tesla’s supply chain, \\ninformed by engagement with local experts, community organizations and civil society.\\n\\nBattery Supply Chain\\n#1 The Tesla Approach\\n\\n>95% \\nLithium hydroxide sourced directly\\n\\n>50%\\nCobalt sourced directly\\n\\n>30%\\nNickel sourced directly\\n\\n\\n\\n1 0 1\\n\\nOur diversified cathode strategy\\n\\nTesla’s batteries today contain a variety of different cathode chemistries, including nickel-cobalt-aluminum \\n(NCA) and nickel-cobalt-manganese (NCM) for higher energy applications and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) for \\nlower energy applications. Tesla will continue to advance a diversified cathode strategy for LFP, nickel-rich and \\nmanganese-rich cathodes to address various market segments for vehicle and energy storage products and \\nprovide future flexibility based on raw materials availability and pricing. To put this into context, lithium only \\naccounts for roughly 1.5% of the full battery pack weight. Additionally, iron phosphate battery packs contain no \\ncobalt or nickel. \\n\\nWhile the relative cathode compositions and our overall demand of various minerals and battery-grade \\nchemicals will continue to evolve, Tesla and the global battery supply chain will require significant quantities of \\nresponsibly produced lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese, iron, phosphates and many other minerals for the \\nforeseeable future. While we recognize the critical role battery recycling will play in supplying a portion of these \\nmaterials to enable a closed loop supply chain, global cell production will continue to rely heavily on primary, \\nmined materials to meet the growing demand in the short to medium term. The availability and affordability of \\nthese minerals and chemicals are key to advancing Tesla’s mission and accelerating the transition to sustainable \\nenergy. We will continue to collaborate with our suppliers and upstream producers in providing visibility to \\nenable the scale up of key battery minerals.\\n\\nFor cells containing NCA and NCM cathodes, we continue to work toward batteries that contain higher levels of \\nnickel in order to improve vehicle range while lowering overall battery costs, without compromising overall cell \\nperformance, such as battery safety and lifetime, that is currently enabled by cobalt. It is important to note that \\nwe expect our absolute cobalt demand to increase over the coming years because our vehicle and cell \\nproduction growth rate is forecasted to outpace the overall rate of cobalt reduction on a per cell basis.\\n\\nBattery Supply Chain\\n#1 The Tesla Approach\\n\\nP\\nNickel-Cobalt-Aluminum Cathode Nickel-Manganese-Cobalt Cathode Lithium-Iron-Phosphate Cathode\\n\\n\\n\\n1 0 2\\n\\nBattery Supply Chain\\n#2 Risk Identification\\n\\nCollect and review environmental and social data to identify risks\\n\\nIn the past year, Tesla collected environmental and social data in its cobalt, lithium and nickel supply chains \\nthrough the following main activities:\\n\\n2.1 Audits\\n\\nAudits are an important tool for Tesla to gather environmental and social data for cobalt, nickel and lithium. \\n\\n• In 2021, 83% of refiners and mine sites in Tesla’s supply chain, including 100% of refiners and mine sites from \\nwhom Tesla sources directly, either underwent or committed to undergo independent external sustainability \\naudits against one of the following sustainability and responsible mining standards: IRMA Standard, the \\nResponsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP), Towards Sustainable \\nMining (TSM) and/or the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) Performance Expectations.\\n\\n• In addition, Tesla conducted six audits in the battery supply chain tailored to Tesla’s specific environmental \\nand social requirements, including the OECD guidance and environmental management systems.

Overall, key drivers are the cathode and anode supply chains. Within \\nthe cathode supply chain, the hotspots are nickel and lithium, and cobalt was only a minimal contributor. Within \\nthe cobalt, nickel and lithium supply chains, chemical processing (refining / smelting) was a larger driver than \\nmining. \\n\\nCO2e Contribution from Materials and Processes within Nickel-Based Battery Supply Chain\\n\\nUpstream of Tesla\\n\\n\\n\\n1 0 5\\n\\nBattery Supply Chain\\n#2 Risk Identification\\n\\n2.3 GHG emissions hotspot identification\\n\\nTesla complemented the hotspot analysis with data collected during a pilot blockchain traceability project for \\nnickel sourced from Tesla nickel supplier, BHP, that traced nickel from a mine site in Australia to Tesla and \\ncollected GHG emissions data for every step.

This is why Tesla \\nprovides funding to, and sits on, the Steering Committee of the Fair Cobalt Alliance (FCA), a multi-stakeholder \\ninitiative to support the improvement of conditions in communities impacted by artisanal mining through the \\nfollowing activities:\\n\\n• Occupational health and safety awareness raising campaign for mine workers\\n• First aid training for mine workers and selection of safety captains\\n• Distribution of protective equipment to washer women\\n• Creation of savings groups for mining community members paired with financial literacy training\\n• Development of referral system for children engaged in mining activities, including child labor notification \\n\\nprotocol, remediation solution packages, and guidelines for case managers on remediation steps, in \\ncollaboration with the NGO, Save the Children\\n\\n• Trainings related to child rights\\n• Electrification of five schools covering students through the distribution of solar-chargeable portable lamps\\n• A marketplace and football field selected for the placement of lighting poles\\n\\nAttendees of a first aid training organized by the FCA \\nin the DRC\\n\\n\\n\\n1 1 0\\n\\nBattery Supply Chain\\n#4 Collaboration with Industry Initiatives\\n\\nCollaboration with industry initiatives\\n\\nTesla understands that many of the environmental and social issues in global EV supply chains do not concern \\nTesla, alone. Tesla is actively engaging in multi-stakeholder forums and industry groups to find industry-wide \\nsolutions to industry-wide questions:\\n\\n• Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA): Tesla joined IRMA as a Member in 2021 to support \\nresponsible mining practices and transparent and robust audit processes that emphasize community \\ninterviews. It is important to Tesla that NGOs and communities actively participate in third-party audits of \\nmines against the IRMA Standard, as their perspectives provide greater context on mining operations and the \\nimpacts of extraction, while also increasing accountability and identifying opportunities for improvement.\\n\\n• Global Battery Alliance (GBA): Tesla has been involved in the GBA since 2020 and has served on the GBA \\nBoard and Battery Passport Steering Committee since 2021. Tesla’s goal as part of the GBA is to advocate for \\nhigh standards for responsible battery materials sourcing, align with EU regulatory requirements, and \\nsupport the development of actionable guidance related to GHG emissions data collection, recycling, and in-\\ncountry environmental and social projects.\\n\\n• Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI): Tesla is a member of the RMI to support the RMI’s refiner audit \\nprograms and industry-wide responsible sourcing dialogue.\\n\\n• IFC Net Zero Roadmap Working Group: Tesla has participated in the IFC Working Group since early 2022 to \\nprovide a downstream perspective in the development of actionable guidance for mine sites to reduce \\ncarbon emissions.\\n\\n• Re|Source: Tesla participates in the supply chain-wide Re|Source consortium to pilot blockchain-supported \\ntraceability in the cobalt supply chain. Tesla offers insights from an OEM perspective on metrics critical to \\ntraceability efforts and works with the consortium towards the first end-to-end blockchain-enabled tracing of \\ncobalt material starting from Tesla’s supplier in the DRC to Gigafactory Shanghai.\\n\\n• Fair Cobalt Alliance (FCA): Please see the previous page.\\n\\n\\n\\n1 1 1\\n\\nBattery Supply Chain\\nOutlook\\n\\nOutlook for battery supply chain responsible sourcing: Formalization and expansion\\n\\nTesla’s battery responsible sourcing program is still relatively new. Yet, the program has achieved several \\nimportant milestones this last year, including the development and initial implementation of a system to identify \\nenvironmental and social risks in the battery supply chain and concrete progress towards mitigation and \\nimproving the situation of stakeholders impacted by Tesla’s battery supply chain.\\n\\nIn 2022, Tesla plans to continue building on momentum of the program and improve on the data points shared \\nin this report, including the development of supply chain GHG emissions reduction plans and further projects \\nand investments in mining countries to have a positive environmental and social impact. Tesla will then explore \\nan expansion to manganese, graphite, copper and mica. \\n\\n\\n\\n1 1 2\\n\\nTesla’s Supplier Audit program\\n\\nIn 2018, Tesla initiated its Supplier Audit program with the objective to extend our supplier performance \\nevaluation to key environmental and social impact metrics relevant to Tesla’s business. This program extension \\nwas introduced at the time when Tesla was transitioning from a small automotive manufacturer to a company \\ngaining recognition as the leader in electrical vehicle production. We recognized that this growth came with an \\nincreased ability to impact positive change on the practices of our suppliers, but also with an increased \\nresponsibility to drive such change in line with our mission statement. During the program pilot phase, we \\nfocused our efforts on suppliers that we deemed high risk based on their industry or the use of potentially \\ndangerous processes and/or chemicals in the manufacturing of our parts.\\n\\nWe chose to utilize the Responsible Business Alliance’s (RBA) Validated Assessment Program (VAP) as the \\nbasis for our audits. The RBA’s VAP is an audit protocol globally recognized for its breadth of topics and \\nstringent requirements for supplier completion. It covers nearly 200 checkpoints across labor, health and safety, \\nenvironmental, ethical and management system topics. Audits are conducted by independent third parties that \\nare approved by the RBA, and all auditors must undergo training by the RBA on the audit standard and its \\nimplementation ensuring a globally and industry-wide standardized approach.\\n\\nIn any case where any priority non-conformance (the most significant type) occurs, our audit procedures \\nrequire that suppliers undergo a closure audit. These closure audits – which are a follow up to the original audit \\nwhere the non-conformances were identified – allow suppliers to address all non-conformances in the earlier \\naudits. Additional audits, rather than an immediate suspension of the business relationship, are preferred to \\nimprove working conditions and reduce the risk of continued deficiencies.\\n\\nAs of the end of 2021, we had a total of 152 supplier locations go through our supplier audit at least once, \\nrepresenting 144 suppliers, or 10% of 2021 spend with our direct supply base. As part of these audits over 4,000 \\nsupplier employee interviews were conducted.\\n\\nResponsible Sourcing\\nSupplier Audit Program\\n\\n\\n\\n1 1 3\\n\\nContinuing to expand our audit program\\n\\nIn 2021, Tesla redefined its criteria for determining which of our suppliers are subject to the Supplier Audit \\nprogram. While in its initial stages the suppliers subject to the audit were mainly located in China, and the \\nupdated criteria expanded the scope to include significantly more suppliers globally. When we started our audit \\nprogram, we had only just announced our plans for Gigafactory Shanghai. We now have six factories across \\nthree different continents, and our production volume of vehicles has grown exponentially. As our global \\nfootprint and manufacturing grew, so did our supply base. Therefore, the expansion of our audit program was \\nan important step to ensure that our supplier due diligence efforts continue to reflect the realities of our supply \\nchain and can properly identify and address potential risks within our supply base.\\n\\nThe criteria on which suppliers are selected to undergo the Supplier Audit is based on an expanded risk \\nassessment approach, looking at Tesla’s exposure to suppliers financially, as well as suppliers’ location. This \\ncriteria determines which suppliers are obligated to undergo an audit, but additional suppliers can be \\nnominated by our commercial and supplier industrialization teams where they see value in doing so or the \\npotential to further mitigate risk. With the expanded audit program scope, we are targeting to cover over 50% \\nof our global spend with our direct supply base.\\n\\nAs part of our program expansion, we are building on our ability to influence supplier behavior in a positive \\nway. When a supplier is not meeting our expectations, they are obligated to implement corrective action plans \\nto remedy any deficiencies or non-conformances found during the audit process, regardless of the severity. In \\ncases of the highest priority non-conformances, suppliers are required to undergo closure audits to ensure that \\ntheir corrective action plans have been fully implemented. In cases of less severe non-conformances, suppliers \\nare still required to develop and implement corrective action plans as well as provide evidence to Tesla that \\nthose plans have been fully implemented within our expected timelines.\\n\\nFurthermore, we defined a separate category called Zero Tolerance Violations, which, for example, include any \\nviolations related to the use of forced or child labor and inhumane treatment of workers. In cases where such \\ninstances are discovered, our supply chain leadership will be informed, and a corrective action plan will be \\ndeveloped immediately, together with the supplier. Tesla will transition away from the supplier relationship if the \\nsupplier is unable or unwilling to correct the identified issues and improve their operations within a reasonable \\ntime frame.\\n\\nResponsible Sourcing\\nSupplier Audit Expansion\\n\\n\\n\\n1 1 4\\n\\nHow we identify and prioritize risks in our supply chain\\n\\nOur Supplier Audit program is an important part of our efforts to identify and address environmental and social \\nrisks within our supply chain. These audits allow for a snapshot of a supplier facility’s programs and procedures, \\nbut also sets a baseline for future evaluations. Additionally, Tesla utilizes other avenues to evaluate potential \\nrisks in our supply chain such as those detailed below.\\n\\nWe engaged with several third-party service providers allowing us to continually monitor our supply chain for \\nemerging issues that may affect our suppliers. These include issues related to labor relations, human rights and \\nenvironmental degradation. This monitoring allows our Global Supply Managers to be notified as soon as \\ninformation about suppliers becomes public and act by engaging directly with the supplier to understand their \\nplans for correcting the identified risk.\\n\\nTesla follows the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct when identifying risks within \\nour supply chain. We require suppliers to cooperate with our efforts and assist in identifying and removing \\npractices within our supply chain that are contradictory to our policies. Our responsible sourcing policies \\nrequire suppliers to provide requested information regarding potential violations of our policies. Furthermore, \\nwe continue to leverage our membership with the RBA to identify upcoming supply chain risks as well as \\nunderstand industry best practices to address them. We are actively involved with the RMI as well as specific \\naction groups within the organization. In addition, we have utilized many of the RBA tools, such as country risk \\nanalysis to understand inherent risks in our supply chain and RBA-Online to collect information on corporate \\nand factory-specific supplier performance.\\n\\nResponsible Sourcing\\nIdentifying Priorities\\n\\n\\n\\n1 1 5\\n\\nAcross all audits, we found no instances of child labor, forced labor or inhumane treatment of workers\\n\\nThe table below details findings of our audits across all suppliers regardless of severity and includes initial \\naudits as well as closure audits. Through July 2021, our suppliers have addressed and remedied 100% of priority \\nnon-conformances, with the remaining open priority findings to be addressed in upcoming closure audits. Our \\ninitial focus on high-risk suppliers allowed us to cover more than 70% of this group in the first three years of the \\naudit program and gave us an understanding of suppliers to prioritize in an expanded program. \\n\\nIn all audits conducted at Tesla's request at supplier manufacturing facilities producing Tesla products, we found \\nno instances of child labor, forced labor or inhumane treatment.\\n\\nIn 2021, the five most common findings were related to (% of total findings within each category)2:\\n1. Working Hours (20.4%): no more than 60 hours work per week, overtime is voluntary, one day off per seven \\n\\ndays\\n2. Emergency Preparedness (11.1%):  proper permitting, emergency risk assessment at 11.1% of total findings; \\n3. Wages and Benefits (9.4%): proper calculation of regular and overtime wages, timely payment of wages; \\n4. Occupational Safety (7.5%): availability of PPE, proper permitting; and \\n5. Freely Chosen Employment (5.5%): contract provided in worker’s native language, no excessive penalty for \\n\\nleaving position \\n\\nResponsible Sourcing\\nSupplier Audit Findings\\n\\n1 Over the past two years, global pandemic conditions have significantly impacted our suppliers’ ability to schedule on-site audits, leading to a \\ndecrease in our annual audit numbers.\\n2 The colors of percentages above indicate their inclusion in broader categories in the table. For example, Working Hours is a subcategory of Labor \\nand, therefore, both are colored blue.\\n\\nSupplier Audit Findings (2018-2021)\\n\\n2018 2019 20201 20211\\n\\nAudits Conducted 12 108 81 41\\n\\nAverage Non-Conformance per Audit 28 21 16 15\\n\\nBreakdown of Findings by Topic (%)\\nLabor 30% 30% 31% 37%\\n\\nHealth & Safety 30% 27% 30% 33%\\n\\nEnvironment 14% 14% 13% 14%\\n\\nEthics 6% 4% 2% 1%\\n\\nManagement Systems 20% 25% 24% 15%\\n\\nTotal 100% 100% 100% 100%\\n\\n\\n\\nSupporting Materials\\n\\n\\n\\n1 1 7\\n\\nSummary – Corporate Governance\\n\\nTopic Description Page(s)\\n\\nIntroduction\\nSound corporate governance is critical to our mission. We are committed to establishing an operating framework \\nthat exercises appropriate oversight of responsibilities at all levels throughout the company and manages its \\naffairs consistent with high principles of business ethics.\\n\\n11 - 12\\n\\nOur Approach to Corporate \\nGovernance\\n\\nOur unique business requires a unique approach to corporate governance. And our mission requires a long-term \\nfocus that we believe will ultimately maximize value to our employees and our stockholders. Our corporate \\ngovernance structure has facilitated several key decisions which might have appeared counter-intuitive to some, \\nbut which have set up the Tesla to achieve long-term success.\\n\\n13\\n\\nBoard Committees (as of March 1, \\n2022)\\n\\nThe Board has four standing committees — the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Nominating \\nand Corporate Governance Committee and the Disclosure Controls Committee — which are each further \\ndescribed in this section. \\n\\n14 - 15\\n\\nCompensation Philosophy\\n\\nOur compensation philosophy reflects our long-term mission and our startup origins. We emphasize structuring \\ncompensation to reward our named executive officers based on performance, and equity awards weigh heavily in \\nour named executive officers’ total compensation, including awards that vest upon the achievement of clear and \\nmeasurable milestones. \\n\\n16\\n\\nData Privacy and Cybersecurity\\n\\nTesla builds products with privacy and security at their core. Additionally, managing data privacy is a shared task \\nthrough all levels of our organization. Our privacy principles are: 1. We build privacy into our products from start \\nto finish; 2. We give customers choices about their data; 3. We maintain trust through transparency; and 4. We \\nsafeguard personal data.\\n\\n17 - 18\\n\\nHuman Rights\\n\\nThe ethical treatment of all people and regard for human rights is core to our mission of a sustainable future. We \\nbelieve all businesses within our supply chain have a responsibility to share our respect for human rights. Our \\nhuman rights policy is the formalization of our commitment to uphold and respect these rights and the values \\nthey represent. We have a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to child or forced labor and human trafficking by \\nour suppliers.\\n\\n19 - 20\\n\\n\\n\\n1 1 8\\n\\nSummary – People and Culture\\n\\nTopic Description Page(s)\\n\\nIntroduction\\nTesla's employees are its greatest asset and critical to achieving our mission. Our People Strategy is centered on \\nproviding meaningful work, a respectful, safe, inclusive and equitable workplace, compensating our people well, \\nand making our benefits an outlier.\\n\\n22\\n\\nAttracting Employees\\n\\nOur employee count has grown ~70 fold over the past decade and, in just over ten years, created nearly 100,000 \\ndirect jobs. Whether it is through our direct hiring opportunities, internships or workforce development \\nprograms, interest in joining Tesla’s mission is at an all-time high. We had more than 3,000,000 unique \\napplicants globally in 2021 alone.\\n\\n23 - 27\\n\\nCompensating Employees\\n\\nTesla provides a highly competitive wage that meets or exceeds the wages of comparable manufacturing roles, \\neven before equity and benefits are factored in, and we want our benefits to be an outlier in the manufacturing \\nindustry. We have an annual pay equity program in place, designed to assess whether similarly situated \\nemployees are paid in a similar manner after accounting for a range of variables. \\n\\n28 - 32\\n\\nRetaining Employees\\n\\nAs Model 3 has become the best-selling premium sedan globally and our profitability (operating margin) has rose \\nto the highest in the industry, employee satisfaction has improved. This has fueled our ability to expand \\ndramatically and provide career opportunities for many strong performers. As nearly 70% of our leadership is \\npromoted from within Tesla, our employees are surrounded by examples of successful progression. \\n\\n33 - 34\\n\\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\\n\\nWe are proud to be a majority-minority company with a large representation of employees from communities \\nthat have long struggled to break through the historic roadblocks to equal opportunity in the U.S. As of \\nDecember 31, 2020, 34% of our directors and vice presidents are people of color. This year we published our \\nlatest EEO-1 data for the first time.\\n\\n35 - 41\\n\\nRespectful Workplace\\nWe strive to create an environment where people love to come to work every day. With over 100,000 \\nemployees as of March 2022, challenges arise, and we address them head on. In 2021, we re-doubled our efforts \\nto educate employees and managers that any form of discrimination must be reported. \\n\\n42 - 43\\n\\nEmployee Engagement\\nEmployee engagement drives productivity, satisfaction and loyalty and plays a critical role in employee \\nretention. Tesla’s engagement initiatives strive to make employees feel informed, valued and respected, while \\ncompany-wide open-door policies with leaders empower employees to make their ideas heard. \\n\\n44\\n\\nDisaster Relief\\n\\nWe are committed to providing disaster relief through product donations. Our disaster relief efforts have \\nprovided 100% clean, emissions free emergency power to people in Ukraine, New Orleans after Hurricane Ida, \\nand Kentucky and Texas after sever winter storms. We also provided free supercharging to customers in \\ncountries surrounding Ukraine. \\n\\n45 - 46\\n\\nEnvironmental, Health, Safety and \\nSecurity\\n\\nIn 2021, our focus remained on protecting people, the planet, our property and products. We recently deployed \\nour new EHS&S system – MyEHS – in order to better collect and manage data, allowing us to make decision that \\nreduce risk. Furthermore, in 2021, our ATSM Global Serious Injury Rate remained below the industry average.\\n\\n47 - 54\\n\\n\\n\\n1 1 9\\n\\nSummary – Environmental Impact\\n\\nTopic Description Page(s)\\n\\nLifecycle Analysis of Tesla Vehicles \\nversus Average ICE\\n\\nRegardless of where they are driven (U.S., Europe or China), a Model 3 and Model Y emit far fewer greenhouse \\ngas emissions per mile than a comparable ICE. Moving the grid toward more renewables and making our \\noperations and supply chain less GHG intensive will only make this dynamic more pronounced as time goes on.\\n\\n56 – 67\\n\\nGHG Emissions: Scope 1, 2, 3\\n\\nWe have disclosed our full Scope 1 and Scope 2 (location-based) emissions this year. We have also disclosed the \\namount of CO2e emitted through the use of our vehicles (part of Scope 3). The global Supercharger network and \\nhome charging in California were both 100% renewable in 2021, achieved through a combination of onsite \\nresources (for the Supercharger network only) and annual renewable matching. \\n\\n68 – 69\\n\\nNOx, Particulates and Other Pollutants\\nNew research shows that fossil fuels are alone responsible for more than 8 million premature deaths annually, or \\nalmost one out of every five deaths globally, double previous estimates. Zero tailpipe emissions is a commonly \\noverlooked benefit of EVs.\\n\\n70\\n\\nTesla Semi's Impact on Emissions\\nTesla Semi is poised to make a large impact: in the U.S., combination trucks make up just 1.1% of the vehicle fleet \\nbut account for 17.9% of annual emissions. 71\\n\\nWaste Generated per Vehicle \\nManufactured\\n\\nAs we continue to build new, more efficient factories our ability to limit packaging and reduce waste increases. \\nWaste generated per vehicle in Shanghai production is 60% less than our manufacturing in the U.S. We continue \\nto push for innovative approaches to reducing waste as we expand our global operations.\\n\\n72\\n\\nWater Used per Vehicle Manufactured\\nWater use per vehicle produced by Tesla was again below the industry average in 2021. Our new factories such as \\nGigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg will set a new standard when it comes to low water use per vehicle. 73 - 74\\n\\nEmissions Credits\\nIn 2021, Tesla delivered more than 2x as many EVs as our next closest competitor, helping drive $1.5bn in revenue \\nfrom selling regulatory credits. This money is being used to accelerate our production capacity deployment in \\ndirect support of our mission.\\n\\n75\\n\\n\\n\\n1 2 0\\n\\nSummary – Product Impact\\n\\nTopic Description Page(s)\\nProduct Affordability \\n(Price Equivalency & \\nTotal Cost of Ownership)\\n\\nModel 3 is price competitively with ICE equivalents. But, when compared on a total cost of ownership basis, the \\nModel 3 is much closer to a Toyota Camry on all-in cost per mile than to an ICE equivalent such as a BMW 3 \\nSeries.\\n\\n77 - 78\\n\\nProduct Usage & Usability\\nOur data shows that Tesla vehicles are being driven more than average vehicles in the U.S., suggesting that they \\nare generally being used as a customer’s primary vehicle. The superior range of our vehicles and a robust global \\nSupercharger Network makes this possible.\\n\\n79 - 80\\n\\nVehicle Safety\\nAt Tesla, safety features are not optional. Our full suite of safety features comes standard with every vehicle. \\nWhen we design vehicles, first and foremost, we want them to be safe. Our active safety features are powered by \\neight cameras, a neural-net computer and learnings from our fleet of over two million cars. \\n\\n81 – 84\\n\\nAutopilot Safety\\n\\nIn 2021, we recorded 0.22 crashes for every million miles driven in which drivers were using Autopilot technology \\n(Autosteer and active safety features). For drivers who were not using Autopilot technology (no Autosteer and \\nactive safety features), we recorded 0.77 crashes for every million miles driven. By comparison, NHTSA’s most \\nrecent data shows that in the United States there are 1.81 automobile crashes for every million miles driven.\\n\\n85\\n\\nData Driven Safety\\nTesla strived to go beyond industry standard testing. We leverage data from our fleet of over two million cars to \\nbetter understand accidents and build solutions around them. 86 - 87\\n\\nPassive Safety & Tesla Safety Awards Since 2019, Tesla vehicles earned 5-star ratings from safety rating agencies across the U.S., Europe and Australia. 88 - 89\\n\\nFire Risk\\nFrom 2012 to 2021, there has been approximately five Tesla vehicle fires for every billion miles traveled. By \\ncomparison, data from the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and U.S. Department of Transportation \\nshow that in the U.S. there are 53 vehicle fires for every billion miles travelled.\\n\\n90\\n\\nSolar + Storage Products\\nPairing energy storage with renewables is required to transition our grid to zero-emission sources. In 2021, in \\norder to meet demand that is well in excess of supply for energy storage products, Tesla began building a new \\nproduction facility capable of producing 40,000,000 kWh of energy storage per year.\\n\\n91- 92\\n\\nResilience of the Grid\\nElectric grid disturbances in the U.S. have increased dramatically over the last 15 years. Our solar and storage \\nproducts not only deliver cost savings and energy independence, but they also harden the grid from adverse \\nevents in a cost-effective and environmentally friendly manner.\\n\\n93\\n\\n\\n\\n1 2 1\\n\\nSummary – Supply Chain\\n\\nTopic Description Page(s)\\n\\nIntroduction\\nProtecting human rights and the environment is core to our procurement strategy. Our responsible sourcing \\nstrategy aims to increase the share of direct procurement and continually improve local conditions of the \\ncommunities from where we source.\\n\\n95\\n\\nBattery Recycling\\nTesla is building capacity to recycle manufacturing scrap and end of life batteries in order to close the loop on \\nbattery raw materials. By the end of 2021, our battery recycling facility at Gigafactory Nevada achieved a \\nproduction rate of over 50 tons of recycled material per week.\\n\\n96 - 97\\n\\nAlignment with Best Practices\\nOur responsible sourcing program is based on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Mineral Supply \\nChains. This means Tesla collects data from its supply chain (including through audits), translates this data into \\non-the-ground actions and discloses the outcomes in our annual Impact Report.\\n\\n98\\n\\nBattery Supply Chain\\n\\nWe have prioritized responsible sourcing activities for cobalt, lithium and nickel given their unique significance to \\nEVs and energy storage. To ensure we are appropriately managing risk, we continue to map our supply chain, \\nconduct in third-party audits and on-the-ground engagements, and collaborate with industry initiatives to ensure \\nour suppliers are living up to our strict standards. \\n\\n99 - 111\\n\\nResponsible Sourcing & \\nTesla Supplier Audit Program\\n\\nIn 2018, Tesla initiated its Supplier Audit program with the objective to extend our supplier performance \\nevaluation to key environmental, social, and governance metrics relevant to Tesla’s business. As of the end of \\n2021, we had a total of 152 supplier locations go through our Suppler Audit at least once, representing 144 \\nsuppliers, or 10% of 2021 spend with our direct supply base. \\n\\n112 - 115\\n\\n\\n\\n1 2 2\\n\\nAppendix\\nKey Metrics\\n\\nAverage Lifecycle Emissions (gCO2e/mi)\\n\\nDelivery-weighted U.S. Average Manufacturing Phase use-phase Total New York State Manufacturing Phase use-phase Total\\n\\nModel 3 Ridesharing Use\\n(solar charged) 29 0 29\\n\\nModel 3 Ridesharing Use\\n(solar charged) 29 0 29\\n\\nModel 3 Personal Use\\n(solar charged) 70 0 70\\n\\nModel 3 Personal Use\\n(solar charged) 70 0 70\\n\\nModel 3 Ridesharing Use\\n(grid charged) 10 111 121\\n\\nModel 3 Ridesharing Use\\n(grid charged) 10 78 88\\n\\nModel 3 Personal Use\\n(grid charged) 51 111 162\\n\\nModel 3 Personal Use\\n(grid charged) 51 78 129\\n\\nAvg.

To start, we identified over 40 issues in key areas that could \\ndirectly or indirectly impact our business. The topics ranged from economic, environmental, social and \\ngovernance issues. These issues were identified from four components: (1) a competitive landscape review, (2) \\ninterviews with investors and other key external stakeholders, (3) industry reports and documented research, \\nsuch as the World Economic Forum’s 2021 Global Risks Report and (4) external ESG frameworks relevant to our \\nindustry and regulatory requirements across global capital markets.\\n\\nTesla’s Sustainability Council refined the list of 40 key issues into a survey containing 25 questions in an effort \\nto help us prioritize these topics for operational management and disclosure in this year’s Impact Report. As \\npart of the assessment, we surveyed our key stakeholders, asking them to rate the identified economic and ESG \\ntopics on a scale of 1-5, based on their perceived importance and impact to Tesla’s business. A total of 2,168 \\nindividuals from Tesla and approximately 40 external partners, including trade associations, universities, \\nsuppliers, environmental consultants, nonprofits and local administrators, responded to the survey. 35% of \\nresponses came from North America, 57% from China and 8% from Europe.

We endorse and base our definition of human rights on the United Nation's Universal Declaration for Human Rights (“UDHR”). The UDHR \\nfocuses on dignity, respect, and equality, without discrimination, for all people. We are committed to upholding these rights and values throughout our value chain – including with respect to our \\nemployees, customers, shareholders, suppliers, and the communities in which we operate.\\n\\nHealth and Safety\\n\\nSuppliers are responsible for ensuring that their employees and \\ncontractors are provided with a safe and healthy work \\nenvironment.\\n\\nRespectful Workplace and Equal Opportunities\\n\\nTesla recognizes the value of different backgrounds and \\nperspectives in our workforce, and fully promotes equal \\nopportunity for all employees, both current and prospective. \\nJust as we do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, \\nreligion, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression or \\nidentity, national origin, disability, medical condition, military \\nand veteran status, marital status, pregnancy or any other \\ncharacteristic protected by law, regulation or ordinance, we \\nrequire our suppliers to similarly respect the people in their \\nworkforces.\\n\\nEnvironmental Protection\\n\\nWe expect our suppliers to share our goal of recognizing \\nenvironmental protection as a key principle of a sustainable \\nfuture.\\n\\nChild Labor and Young Workers\\n\\nTesla strictly follows local and national laws restricting the \\nemployment of underage workers. Regardless of local laws, no \\nworkers at a facility or location that provides materials used in \\nTesla products may be under the age of 15.\\n\\nRelationship with Communities\\n\\nTesla is dedicated to being a responsible member of the \\ncommunities in which we live and operate. This goes beyond our \\nability to create jobs and contribute to local value creation. We \\nexpect suppliers to also take every effort to continuously \\nimprove the positive aspects and reduce any negative impact of \\ntheir operations on the local community, including with respect \\nto environmental, social, and other quality of life factors.\\n\\nIndigenous Rights\\n\\nThe mining industry on which Tesla relies to source many raw \\nmaterials that go into our products has historically had an \\nadverse impact on the rights of indigenous peoples and \\ncommunities in the areas in which they operate. For all raw \\nmaterial extraction and processing used in Tesla products, we \\nexpect our mining industry suppliers to engage with legitimate \\nrepresentatives of indigenous communities and include the right \\nto free and informed consent in their operations.\\n\\nThe following tables provide summaries of our responsible sourcing policies, the full text of which can be found on our Responsible Sourcing Policies page:\\n\\nhttps://www.tesla.com/legal/additional-resources#responsible-sourcing-policies\\n\\n\\n1 2 8\\n\\nThe following tables provide summaries of our responsible sourcing policies, the full text of which can be found on our Responsible Sourcing Policies page:\\n\\nAppendix\\nSupply Chain Policies\\n\\nTesla Responsible Materials Policy\\n\\nSuppliers are required to use reasonable efforts to ensure that \\ntheir parts and products supplied to Tesla do not contribute to \\narmed conflict, human rights abuses, or environmental \\ndegradation, regardless of sourcing location.

The term “child” refers to any person under the greater of (i) the age of 15, (ii) the minimum applicable legal age \\nfor completing compulsory education in a country, or (iii) under the minimum legal age for employment in the country. Workers under the age of 18 (Young Workers) shall not \\nperform work that is likely to jeopardize their health or safety, including night shifts and overtime. If child labor is identified, assistance and remediation according to the \\nstricter of international standards or local standards shall be provided.\\n\\nWorking Hours\\nWorking hours are not to exceed the maximum set by local law. Further, a workweek should not be more than 60 hours per week, including overtime, except in emergency or \\nuncommon circumstances. All overtime must be voluntary. Workers shall be allowed at least one day off every seven days, defined as a rest period of at least 24 consecutive \\nhours every seven days. Suppliers must keep employee working hour and pay records in accordance with local and national laws and provide records to Tesla upon request.\\n\\nNon-\\nDiscrimination/Non-\\nHarassment\\n\\nSuppliers should be committed to a workplace free of harassment and unlawful discrimination. Companies shall not engage in discrimination or harassment based on race, \\ncolor, age, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, ethnicity or national origin, disability, pregnancy, religion, political affiliation, union membership, \\ncovered veteran status, protected genetic information or marital status in hiring and employment practices such as wages, promotions, rewards, and access to training.\\n\\nHealth and Safety\\nSuppliers recognize that in addition to minimizing the incidence of work-related injury and illness, a safe and healthy work environment enhances the quality of products and \\nservices, consistency of production and worker retention and morale. Suppliers also recognize that ongoing worker input and education are essential to identifying and \\nsolving health and safety issues in the workplace\\n\\nOccupational Safety\\n\\nWorker potential for exposure to health and safety hazards (chemical, electrical and other energy sources, fire, vehicles, and fall hazards, etc.) are to be identified and \\nassessed, mitigated using the Hierarchy of Controls, which includes eliminating the hazard, substituting processes or materials, controlling through proper design, \\nimplementing engineering and administrative controls, preventative maintenance and safe work procedures (including lockout/tagout), and providing ongoing occupational \\nhealth and safety training.\\n\\nEmergency \\nPreparedness\\n\\nPotential emergency situations and events are to be identified and assessed, and their impact minimized by implementing emergency plans and response procedures \\nincluding emergency reporting, employee notification and evacuation procedures, worker training, and drills. Emergency plans should also include appropriate fire detection \\nand suppression equipment, clear and unobstructed egress, adequate exit facilities, contact information for emergency responders, and recovery plans.\\n\\nIndustrial Hygiene\\nWorker exposure to chemical, biological, and physical agents is to be identified, evaluated, and controlled according to the Hierarchy of Controls. If any potential hazards \\nwere identified, suppliers shall look for opportunities to eliminate and/or reduce the potential hazards. When hazards cannot be adequately controlled by such means, \\nworkers are to be provided with and use appropriate, well maintained, personal protective equipment free of charge.\\n\\nHealth and Safety \\nCommunication\\n\\nSuppliers shall provide workers with appropriate workplace health and safety information and training in the language of the worker or in a language the worker can \\nunderstand for all identified workplace hazards that workers are exposed to, including but not limited to mechanical, electrical, chemical, fire, physical hazards, pathogens, \\ntoxins, and other health related risks.\\n\\nhttps://www.tesla.com/legal/additional-resources#responsible-sourcing-policies\\n\\n\\n1 3 0\\n\\nThe following tables provide summaries of our responsible sourcing policies, the full text of which can be found on our Responsible Sourcing Policies page:\\n\\nAppendix\\nSupply Chain Policies\\n\\nTesla Supplier Code of Conduct (continued)\\n\\nEnvironment\\nSuppliers recognize that environmental responsibility is integral to producing world-class products.

Our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to \\nsustainable energy directly addresses some of these challenges — our products and services have helped to \\ncreate industry demand for sustainable energy products.\\n\\nIn 2021, as part of our Impact program, we reviewed the issues and topics most material to Tesla (identified on \\npage 126) and key areas of focus for the Company and mapped them to the most relevant Sustainable \\nDevelopment Goals:\\n\\nAppendix\\nTesla’s Alignment with the \\nUnited Nations’ Sustainable \\nDevelopment Goals\\n\\n\\n\\n1 3 4\\n\\nAppendix\\n\\nMetric / Disclosure / Topic Source(s) Methodology / Definition\\n\\nVehicle use-phase emissions, which represent 80-90% of total automotive emissions \\n(included in Scope 3 of ESG reporting), tend to be misreported due to the use of \\nunrealistic assumptions or not reported at all. OEM sustainability reports\\n\\nAnalysis of sustainability reports by auto OEMs shows unrealistic assumptions for both vehicle life and annual \\nmileage. For those that disclose their methodology we have found that vehicle life is often estimated to be as low \\nas 10 years and annual distance traveled by vehicles as low as 6,200 miles. This compares to an average life of 17 \\nyears in the U.S. (20 years in Europe) and 12,000 annual miles in the U.S. (and 7,450 in Europe). When taken \\ntogether, even before considering the impacts of using real-world MPG instead of NEDC, WLTP or EPA ratings, this \\nleads to a drastic under-reporting of Scope 3 emissions.\\n\\n8.4 million metric tons of CO2e savings Tesla estimate\\n\\nTo estimate CO2e savings, we first measured the amount of miles driven by our vehicles and kWh of electricity \\ngenerated and stored by our solar panels and energy storage products at the state, province, and country level for \\n2021. We then applied an emissions savings factor (in gCO2e/mi for miles driven and gCO2e/kWh for electricity \\ngenerated), for each state, province, and country to estimate CO2e avoided. For miles driven, the emissions savings \\nfactor is the net of estimated emissions from our vehicles and an ICE with a real-world fuel efficiency rating of ~24 \\nmpg. The emissions savings factor is based on grid emissions intensity in each respective location and includes \\nupstream emissions from the production and transport of fuels. \\n\\nTesla Cumulative Net Energy Impact: 2012–2021 (TWh) Tesla\\n\\nFigures based on actual electricity consumption from utility bills for 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. 2020 and 2021 \\nfigures also include measured consumption for on-site fuel use including propane, diesel and gasoline. Figures for \\n2012-2017 for electricity, and 2012-2019 for on-site fuel use, are estimated based on actuals scaled for vehicle and \\nbattery production for each respective year and facility. \\n\\nGlobal Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions by Economic Sector\\n\\nCAIT data: Climate Watch. 2020.

This reference \\nvalue is based on a currently produced mid-size premium sedan that is comparable to the Model 3. The accuracy of \\nthis estimate for the other ICE vehicles directly depends on how their material compositions compared to that of \\nthe reference vehicle as well as on the existing variability of environmental impact profiles across different \\ngeographies and suppliers.\\n\\nAs such, the specific carbon footprint (GWP100/kg) of the reference vehicle is only a proxy for the average \\npremium mid-size ICE vehicle. Based on past work on automotive LCAs (Rohde-Brandenburger & Koffler, 2019) \\n(Koffler C. 873 , 2013) (Koffler C. , 2010) (Koffler C. , Krinke, Schebek, & Buchgeister, 2008) (Koffler C. , 2007), the \\nuncertainty of these estimates is estimated to be less than ±20% for a cradle-to-gate system boundary, and \\ntherefore less than ±5% once the use-phase is added.\\n\\nThe reference manufacturer’s Environmental Certificates are calculated using the same BOM import functionality of \\nthe GaBi DfX software used for the Model 3 in the LCA authored by Sphera as well as GaBi 878 databases for all \\nbackground data.\\n\\nBenchmark mid-size premium ICE vehicles include BMW 330i 2.0, Audi A4 2.0, Mercedes-Benz C300 2.0, Alfa \\nRomeo Giulia 2.0, Volvo S60 2.0, Cadillac ATS 2.0, Lexus IS 300 2.0 and Infiniti Q50 2.0.\\nBenchmark cross-over SUV premium ICE vehicles include BMW X3, Audi Q5, Mercedes GLC, Jaguar F-Pace, AR \\nStelvio, Volvo XC60, Cadillac XT5, Lexus NX and Porsche Macan.\\n\\nUse-phase Emissions for Average Mid-Size Premium ICE Consumer Reports\\n\\nFigured based on owner-reported fuel economy from Consumer Reports for the latest available model year (2018-\\n2020, depending on the make/model). 24.8 MPG is representative of the average of Alfa Romeo Giulia , Audi A4, \\nBMW 330i, Cadillac ATS, Infiniti Q50, Lexus IS 300, Mercedes-Benz C300, and Volvo S60. use-phase GWP100 of \\n~400 gCO2e/mi includes gasoline production and distribution emissions from GaBi 2019 databases as well as \\nconsideration of bio-fuel mix of gasoline in the U.S. (~12%).\\n\\nManufacturing Phase Emissions for Model 3 and Model Y Tesla\\n\\nFigure inclusive of: raw and semi-finished material production including transportation, mechanical processing and \\nshaping, battery manufacturing, vehicle assembly and paint shop, all fuels and energy (natural gas, electricity, etc.), \\nother auxiliaries (lubricants, water, etc.) and end-of-life disposal.\\n\\nFigure exclusive of: capital goods (e.g., machinery, buildings), infrastructure (e.g., roads, power transmission \\nsystems), employee commute, external charging equipment and infrastructure, maintenance and service during use, \\npackaging, transport to recycler, disposal of manufacturing waste, inbound transportation from Tier 1 suppliers, \\ndistribution to customers. Excluded activities are estimated to represent minor contributions to the cradle-to-gate \\nas well as the overall LCA results.\\n\\nWhere solar and storage are assumed to be a fuel source for the use-phase of the Model 3Y, emissions were \\nincluded in the manufacturing phase figure. The Model 3Y Rideshare Use (solar charged) scenario is allocated 100% \\nof these emissions on a per mile basis, while the Model 3Y Personal Use (solar charged) scenario is allocated 82% of \\nthese emissions and 18% grid-charged emissions on a per mile basis (based on observed supercharging vs. other \\nsplit).\\n\\nUse-phase Emissions for Model 3 and Model Y\\nTesla; U.S. Department of Energy; IEA; China \\nElectricity Council\\n\\nUse-phase emissions for grid charging are based on Model 3 and Model Y delivery-weighted state, province and \\ncountry level grid mix based on grid carbon intensity data. \\nU.S. Source: U.S. Department of Energy | E.U. + EFTA Source: IEA | China Source: China Electricity Council's China \\nPower Industry Annual Report 2021\\nUse-phase emissions calculated using the geographic distribution of the Model 3 and Model Y in each respective \\nregion based on Tesla's delivery data, which weights state, province and country level carbon intensity figures and \\nassumes no change in grid mix into the future.

In order to be conservative, and normalize our figure based \\non recent vehicle sales trends in each region, we divided total vehicle parc by average vehicles sales in the \\nrespective regions for 2019 and 2020 (latest available data). This resulted in a scrappage age of 17 years and \\n200,000 miles in the U.S. and 20 years and 150,000 miles for Europe.

(Tesla) asserts that \\nthe GHG emissions metrics are presented in accordance with the assessment criteria set \\nforth below. \\n\\nManagement is responsible for the selection of the criteria, which management believes \\nprovide an objective basis for measuring and reporting on the GHG emissions metrics, \\nand for the completeness, accuracy, and validity of the GHG emissions metrics. Tesla’s \\nGHG emissions are rounded to the nearest thousand. \\n\\nOrganizational Boundary\\n\\nTesla uses the operational control approach to account for and report its Scope 1 and \\nScope 2 GHG emissions. This includes sites engaged in manufacturing; sales, service, and \\ndelivery; and other activities described below. Data for acquired sites are included once \\nthe site has been operating for at least a year at the beginning of the reporting period.\\n\\nManagement Assertion \\nScope 1 & 2 GHG Emissions\\n\\nGHG Emissions Disclosure\\n\\n1.

GHG emissions quantification is subject to significant inherent measurement uncertainty \\nbecause of such things as GHG emissions factors that are used in mathematical models to \\ncalculate GHG emissions, and the inability of these models, due to incomplete scientific \\nknowledge and other factors, to accurately measure under all circumstances the relationship \\nbetween various inputs and the resultant GHG emissions. Environmental and energy use \\ndata used in GHG emissions calculations are subject to inherent limitations, given the nature \\nand the methods used for measuring such data. The selection by management of different \\nbut acceptable measurement techniques could have resulted in materially different amounts \\nor metrics being reported.\\n\\nSite Type Site Activities \\nManufacturing Manufacture Tesla products, including vehicles, superchargers, solar tiles, \\n\\nand energy storage products.

Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions are inclusive of carbon dioxide (CO2), \\nnitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4), and industrial gases such as hydrofluorocarbons \\n(HFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6).  Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and nitrogen trifluoride \\n(NF3) are not emitted by Tesla’s sites. These carbon dioxide equivalent emissions utilize \\nGlobal Warming Potentials (GWPs) defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \\nChange’s (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5 – 100 year) unless a different \\nAssessment Report is already embedded in the emission factor source. Carbon dioxide \\nequivalent emissions are calculated by multiplying actual or estimated energy and fuel \\nusage by the relevant emission factor taking into account the equivalent GWP. All \\nemission factors are updated annually where applicable. \\n\\nManagement Assertion\\nScope 1 & 2 GHG Emissions\\n\\n\\n\\n1 4 1\\n\\nGHG Emissions Disclosure (cont.)\\n\\n4. Related to Scope 1 GHG emissions: \\n• Stationary combustion (natural gas): \\n\\n• Combustion from stationary equipment and machinery at all Tesla sites. \\n• Global natural gas usage data was collected from monthly utility invoices obtained \\n\\nfrom third-party providers. \\n• If monthly usage data was not available, Tesla estimated the natural gas usage by \\n\\ndetermining an annual natural gas usage rate per square foot based on actual 2021 \\nmonthly natural gas usage data for sites in a similar geographic location and type \\nof site. This rate was then multiplied by the square footage of the site building \\nspace.\\n\\n• Emission factors: United States (U.S.) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \\nEmission Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories 2022.\\n\\n• Stationary and mobile combustion (propane, diesel, and gasoline): \\n• Combustion from emergency and portable generators, powered industrial vehicles \\n\\n(e.g., forklifts), temporary space heaters, and other portable equipment (e.g., \\nlandscaping equipment) at manufacturing sites. \\n\\n• Propane, diesel, and gasoline usage data was collected from invoices and fuel \\nreports obtained from third-party providers.  \\n\\n• Emission factors: U.S. EPA Emission Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories 2022.\\n• Fleet mobile combustion (diesel and gasoline): \\n\\n• Combustion from the operation of Tesla’s on-road and non-road vehicles (i.e., \\nTesla’s global fleet).\\n\\n• Diesel and gasoline usage (volume) from Tesla’s global fleet was collected from \\nfuel cards issued by Tesla’s fleet management partner. Vehicle miles driven by Tesla \\non-road vehicles was collected from odometer readings and driver logs. \\n\\nManagement Assertion\\nScope 1 & 2 GHG Emissions\\n\\n• Tesla classified vehicles in its global fleet by type: diesel medium and heavy-duty vehicles, \\ndiesel light-duty trucks, gasoline passenger cars, gasoline light-duty trucks, gasoline heavy-\\nduty vehicles, and non-road industrial/commercial equipment. Temporary fleet additions for \\noperational use were categorized as ‘other’, for which only CO2 emissions are calculated, \\nbecause Tesla does not have detailed information on what type of vehicles were rented and \\nmiles driven.\\n\\n• CO2 emissions were calculated by multiplying the relevant emission factor by the volume of \\ndiesel and gasoline used by Tesla’s on-road and non-road vehicles for the year ended \\nDecember 31, 2021. \\n\\n• CH4 and N2O emissions were calculated by multiplying the relevant emission factor \\n(depending on vehicle type and age) by the miles driven by Tesla’s on-road vehicles, and by \\nthe volume of diesel and gasoline used by Tesla’s non-road vehicles, for the year ended \\nDecember 31, 2021. \\n\\n• Emission factors: U.S. EPA Emission Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories 2022. \\n• Process emissions (Gigafactory Nevada lithium-ion battery cell recycling plant): \\n\\n• Emissions from processing manufacturing scrap lithium-ion cells at the Gigafactory Nevada \\ncell recycling plant.  \\n\\n• The quantity of manufacturing scrap processed was collected from Tesla’s cell recycling plant \\noperations team. The concentration of CO2 and CH4 in emissions (emission rates) were \\nmeasured during two emissions source tests. GHG emissions were calculated by multiplying \\nthe quantity of manufacturing scrap processed, as recorded by the recycling plant operations \\nteam, by the CO2 and CH4 emission rates developed based on emissions source tests. \\n\\n• Estimated emissions from the sources above account for approximately 10% of Scope 1 GHG \\nemissions.\\n\\n• Excluded Scope 1 GHG emissions: Tesla excluded the following sources of GHG emissions which \\nare estimated to represent less than 5 percent of Tesla’s reported Scope 1 GHG emissions:\\n\\n• GHG emissions resulting from propane, diesel, and gasoline combustion at Tesla sites not \\nengaged in manufacturing.\\n\\n• GHG emissions from refrigerant loss to the atmosphere.\\n• GHG emissions from emergency stabilization of damaged and potentially damaged lithium-\\n\\nion cells.\\n• GHG emissions resulting from the chemical reaction of two-part polyurethane adhesives\\n\\n\\n\\n1 4 2\\n\\nGHG Emissions Disclosure (cont.)\\n\\n5. Related to Scope 2 GHG emissions (location-based):\\n• GHG emissions from the generation of electricity purchased by Tesla for site operations. \\n\\nFor sites that include Superchargers (electric vehicle fast charging stations), Tesla did \\nnot include electricity procured for customer use through the Supercharger stations as \\nthose emissions are included in Scope 3, Category 11 Use of Sold Products.\\n\\n• Global electricity usage data was collected from monthly utility invoices obtained from \\nthird-party providers.  \\n\\n• The WRI and WBSCD issued additional guidance for Scope 2 emissions in 2015 (in GHG \\nProtocol Scope 2 Guidance, An amendment to the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard), \\nwhich sets forth reporting under both location-based and market-based \\nmethodologies, where the prior version of the GHG Protocol only addressed a location-\\nbased methodology. The location-based method applies average emission factors that \\ncorrespond to the grid where the consumption occurs, whereas the market-based \\nmethod applies emission factors that correspond to energy purchased through \\ncontractual instruments. Where contractual instruments were not purchased, the \\nmarket-based emission factors represent either the residual mix, where available, or the \\nlocation grid-average factors. This management assertion only includes Tesla’s location-\\nbased Scope 2 GHG emissions as Tesla is continuing to implement its processes to \\nmeasure and report its market-based Scope 2 GHG emissions.\\n\\n• Emission factors:\\n• Canada: Environment Canada. 2019 National inventory report: greenhouse gas \\n\\nsources and sinks in Canada.\\n• United Kingdom (UK): UK database published by the Department for Environment \\n\\nFood & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) 2022. \\n• U.S. EPA Emission Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories 2022. \\n• All other countries: International Energy Agency (IEA) Emissions Factors 2021.\\n\\nManagement Assertion\\nScope 1 & 2 GHG Emissions\\n\\n• Estimated emissions from the source above account for  approximately 5% of Scope 2 \\nGHG emissions.\\n\\n• Excluded Scope 2 GHG Emissions: Tesla excluded the following sources of GHG \\nemissions which are estimated to represent less than 5 percent of Tesla’s reported \\nScope 2 GHG emissions: \\n\\n• District heating and cooling.  \\n\\n\\n\\n1 4 3\\n\\nExcept as otherwise noted, this report covers Tesla, Inc.’s fiscal year 2021, and references to “to date,” “currently,” or similar expressions reflect information as of December \\n31, 2021.

Moreover, while we offer to our general employee population restricted \\nstock units that will retain some value even if the market value of our stock decreases, the equity-based \\ncompensation to our directors has been exclusively in the form of stock options, which have zero initial value \\nand accumulate value, if at all, only to the extent that our stock price increases following their grant, through \\nthe applicable vesting dates and until such stock options are ultimately exercised and the underlying shares are \\nsold. The remaining portion of our directors’ compensation has been comprised of cash retainer payments that \\nare relatively modest compared to peer companies and that may be waived at the election of each \\ndirector.

We emphasize structuring  compensation to reward our named executive officers based on performance, and equity awards weigh heavily  in our named executive officers’ total compensation, including awards that vest upon the achievement of clear  and measurable milestones. Since these awards increase in value as our stock price increases (and in the case of  stock option awards, have no value unless our stock price increases following their grant), our named executive  officers’ incentives are closely aligned with the long-term interests of our stockholders.',\n",
       " 'Tesla has no cash bonus program for any of our named executive officers and generally does not provide any  perquisites or tax reimbursements to our named executive officers that are not available to other employees. No  named executive officer has any severance or change of control arrangement, except as reflected in Elon Musk’s  performance-based 2018 CEO Performance Award.  A change in control modifies the vesting requirements of  the 2018 CEO Performance Award such that vesting of the Award’s tranches would be measured based on  Tesla’s market capitalization at the time of the change of the control, without regard to the operational  milestones of the Award. Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, historically earned a base salary that reflected  the applicable minimum wage requirements under California law, and he was subject to income taxes based on  such base salary. However, he has never accepted his salary. Commencing in May 2019 at Mr. Musk’s request, we  eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of this base salary. Consequently, 100% of Mr. Musk’s  compensation is at-risk.',\n",
       " 'Similarly, the compensation program for Tesla’s non-employee directors is designed to be consistent with our  compensation philosophy for our employees, with an emphasis on equity-based compensation over cash in  order to align the value of their compensation with the market value of our stock, and consequently, with the  long-term interests of our stockholders. Moreover, while we offer to our general employee population restricted  stock units that will retain some value even if the market value of our stock decreases, the equity-based  compensation to our directors has been exclusively in the form of stock options, which have zero initial value  and accumulate value, if at all, only to the extent that our stock price increases following their grant, through  the applicable vesting dates and until such stock options are ultimately exercised and the underlying shares are  sold. The remaining portion of our directors’ compensation has been comprised of cash retainer payments that  are relatively modest compared to peer companies and that may be waived at the election of each  director. Further, in June 2021, the Board adopted a resolution that all existing directors forego any automatic  grants of annual stock option awards under our director compensation policy until July 2022 unless the Board  determines otherwise.

      "Current ESG evaluation  methodologies are  fundamentally flawed. To  achieve acutely-needed  change, ESG needs to  evolve to measure real- world Impact. \n",
      "What ESG measures today: Investment Risk \n",
      "Current environmental, social and governance (ESG)  reporting does not measure the scope of positive impact  on the world. Instead, it focuses on measuring the dollar  value of risk / return. \n",
      "Individual investors – who entrust their money to ESG  funds of large investment institutions – are perhaps  unaware that their money can be used to buy shares of  companies that make climate change worse, not better. \n",
      "An obvious example of this is measuring the impact of the  automotive industry. One might think that the more electric  vehicles an automaker sells, as a percentage of total  volumes, the better its ESG score. However, this is not the  case. As long as a company continues to slightly decrease  emissions of its manufacturing operations while churning  out gas-guzzlers, its ESG ratings are likely to go up. \n",
      "Vehicle use-phase emissions, which represent 80-90% of  total automotive emissions (included in Scope 3 of ESG  reporting), tend to be misreported due to the use of  unrealistic assumptions or not reported at all. \n",
      "It’s easy to see why some oil & gas companies rank higher  than Tesla on “Environmental Impact.” \n",
      "“The most striking feature of the [ESG rating] system is  how rarely a company’s record on climate change seems to  get in the way of its climb up the ESG ladder—or even to  factor at all.” \n",
      "ESG Mirage: Bloomberg Businessweek \n",
      "What ESG needs to become: Company Impact \n",
      "We need to create a system that measures and scrutinizes  actual positive impact on our planet, so unsuspecting  individual investors can choose to support companies that  can make and prioritize positive change. \n",
      "On the product front, companies should be required to use  real-world data wherever remotely feasible and make it  clear when estimates are provided instead of real-world  figures. An example of this is vehicle “use-phase”  emissions, accounting for the vast majority of lifecycle  emissions. Automakers' estimates on lifetime vehicle  mileage and lifetime fuel consumption vary dramatically  and almost never reflect real-world data. Automakers often  have access to this data, but they don’t disclose it. \n",
      "When it comes to a company’s employees, it is essential  that they’re treated well, with a system in place to prevent  discrimination of any kind, that they have a safe  workplace and that they are rewarded appropriately, with  significant upside if their employer does well. \n",
      "Many ESG ratings evaluate: “Does this ESG issue impact the  profitability of the company?” We need a system that  evaluates: “Does the growth of this company have a  positive impact on the world?” \n",
      "This evolution of ESG needs to be championed by  institutional investors, rating agencies, public companies  and the general public. As the world needs to strive for a  substantial positive impact, we won’t be referring to ESG in  this report. Instead, we’ll talk about Impact. \n",

To maximize our impact, we plan to continue increasing our production volumes and the  accessibility of our products. In more concrete terms, this means that by 2030 we are aiming to sell 20 million  electric vehicles per year (compared to 0.94 million in 2021) and deploy 1,500 GWh of energy storage per year  (compared to 4 GWh in 2021). \n",
      "If we were to achieve such a vehicle delivery milestone through a consistent growth rate, the total Tesla vehicle  fleet would surpass tens of millions of vehicles by 2030, and each of those vehicles could save tons of CO2e  emissions every year of usage. \n",
      "Furthermore, each product we make must be continuously improved at each step of its lifecycle: from  manufacturing to consumer use to recycling. \n",

      "Our compensation philosophy reflects our long-term mission and our startup origins. We emphasize structuring  compensation to reward our named executive officers based on performance, and equity awards weigh heavily  in our named executive officers’ total compensation, including awards that vest upon the achievement of clear  and measurable milestones. Since these awards increase in value as our stock price increases (and in the case of  stock option awards, have no value unless our stock price increases following their grant), our named executive  officers’ incentives are closely aligned with the long-term interests of our stockholders. \n",
      "Tesla has no cash bonus program for any of our named executive officers and generally does not provide any  perquisites or tax reimbursements to our named executive officers that are not available to other employees. No  named executive officer has any severance or change of control arrangement, except as reflected in Elon Musk’s  performance-based 2018 CEO Performance Award.  A change in control modifies the vesting requirements of  the 2018 CEO Performance Award such that vesting of the Award’s tranches would be measured based on  Tesla’s market capitalization at the time of the change of the control, without regard to the operational  milestones of the Award. Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, historically earned a base salary that reflected  the applicable minimum wage requirements under California law, and he was subject to income taxes based on  such base salary. However, he has never accepted his salary. Commencing in May 2019 at Mr. Musk’s request, we  eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of this base salary. Consequently, 100% of Mr. Musk’s  compensation is at-risk. \n",
      "Similarly, the compensation program for Tesla’s non-employee directors is designed to be consistent with our  compensation philosophy for our employees, with an emphasis on equity-based compensation over cash in  order to align the value of their compensation with the market value of our stock, and consequently, with the  long-term interests of our stockholders. Moreover, while we offer to our general employee population restricted  stock units that will retain some value even if the market value of our stock decreases, the equity-based  compensation to our directors has been exclusively in the form of stock options, which have zero initial value  and accumulate value, if at all, only to the extent that our stock price increases following their grant, through  the applicable vesting dates and until such stock options are ultimately exercised and the underlying shares are  sold. The remaining portion of our directors’ compensation has been comprised of cash retainer payments that  are relatively modest compared to peer companies and that may be waived at the election of each  director. Further, in June 2021, the Board adopted a resolution that all existing directors forego any automatic  grants of annual stock option awards under our director compensation policy until July 2022 unless the Board  determines otherwise.  \n",

These apprenticeships  blend on-the-job training by qualified mentors with classroom learning, providing a holistic approach to  learning a trade in high demand. Apprentices learn welding, machining, blueprint reading and other critical  skills. Similar programs run in Europe, including at the Gigafactory Berlin where we collaborate with local  vocational schools and train students via facilitated workshops, self-led modules and on-the-job exercises for a  variety of roles. \n",

      "To promote gender diversity in STEM, since 2018, Tesla has encouraged girls to see engineering as a means to pursue their goals by participating in Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day. This year, over 1,200 middle school  students from 140 schools across California, Nevada, Texas and New York joined the virtual event which  showcased a variety of engineering career pathways and inspiring female Tesla engineers through virtual tours,  engaging videos and hands-on STEM activities. Similar initiatives take place in Europe, like Girls’ Day, which is  dedicated to girls who want to explore future career paths in the industry. Our aim is to encourage and inspire  them via factory tour visits and conversations with our female employees and leaders. \n",

In  our effort to expand access to our program, we attended more than 75 diversity hiring events targeting women  and students of Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions, and launched new  community Internship Initiatives with Say Yes Buffalo, Breakthrough Austin, TRiO Scholars in Nevada and  College Track in the Bay Area to increase diversity in our program.  \n",

This investment is in partnership with the Department of Education and the Education Gift  Fund, with a focus on initiatives that support the acceleration of robotics, STEAM and sustainability  programming. To date, $22.5M has been invested across 30 organizations and an additional $17M planned in  2022-2023.  \n",

      "Exceeding comparable manufacturing role compensation \n",
      "Tesla provides a highly competitive wage that meets or exceeds the wages of comparable manufacturing roles,  even before equity and benefits are factored in. In 2021, Tesla’s average national wage for manufacturing jobs in  the U.S. was $21.60/hour plus benefits (which, among others listed on the next page, includes an option for $0  cost paycheck deductions) and equity, which is a 2.2% increase compared to 2020. According to the Bureau of  Labor Statistics, the mean hourly wage for Production Associates / Assemblers is $18.17 and the median is  $17.59. Tesla continuously reviews salary and wages against benchmarks and adjusts to ensure wages are  competitive. Evaluations for promotions also take place annually. \n",
      "The impact of stock-based compensation can be material for employees \n",
      "Our employees have benefited enormously from value appreciation of our stock seen through the years. While  share prices will remain volatile and past performance is not indicative of future results, stock-based  compensation brings shared ownership to the workforce, and our employees are encouraged to make a positive  change for the benefit of all. Culturally, shared ownership of the company is one of the most essential attributes  of working at Tesla.  \n",
      "For example, assume that an employee received a grant of 320 Tesla shares in 2018 that vested 20 shares  quarterly over 16 quarters (4 years). Based on the stock price at the time of the grant, the quarterly vest of 20  Tesla shares would equate to $1,331-worth of sellable shares at the end of 2018. However, the same vest two  years later would equate to $14,113-worth of sellable shares per quarter based on the increase in the price per  share of Tesla stock over that period. Employees are also eligible to buy additional stock at a discount through  the Employee Stock Purchase Program. \n",

Compensation, linked to the  performance of the company, also improved substantially in recent years.  \n",

Executives review  organizational demographics and work with their DEI, HR and Recruiting partners to create an action plan to  attract, develop and retain talent. \n",

The fundamental pillar  in this strategy is consistent and fair performance reviews — a reliable review process leads to more equitable  access to internal opportunities. Since 2020, we have routinely delivered performance reviews to over 99% of all  employees globally. The program has led to improvements in our internal mobility program and employees'  access to career opportunities within Tesla. \n",

Electrifying the  heavy-duty truck segment is an essential part of transitioning the world to sustainable energy. \n",
      "Payload equal to a diesel truck \n",
      "With both the U.S. and E.U. having approved higher weight allowances for electric heavy-duty trucks, we expect  the payload to be at least as high as it would be for a diesel truck. In the E.U., electric semi trucks are allowed to  be 2 tons (~4,400 pounds) heavier than diesel equivalents, and in the U.S. the allowance is 0.9 tons (2,000  pounds). When fully loaded, the Tesla Semi should be able to achieve over 500 miles of range, achieved through  aerodynamics and highly efficient motors. This truck will be able to reach an efficiency of over 0.5 miles per  kWh. \n",
      "While most heavy trucking journeys are shorter than 500 miles, we want long-distance hauling to also be  sustainable. We are in the process of developing a Semi charger network at trucking rest stops across the U.S.  and Europe, where each Tesla Semi could top up their range. \n",
      "Tesla Semi is critical to our mission to accelerate the world’s  transition to sustainable energy. Right now, cell availability is  the limiting factor for production – a Tesla Semi requires  multiple times more cells than a passenger vehicle.  \n",

First, because the automotive  supply chain doesn’t have a strong presence on the West Coast of the U.S., many components need to be  shipped from long distances, requiring excessive packaging and creating more waste than necessary. \n",
      "Second, modern factories are better designed for material flow. Trailer entry points surround the whole factory,  which means that components can be offloaded precisely at the part of the factory where they are needed. Less  material flow results in less waste, because a shorter journey requires less protective packaging. The chart  below shows that waste generation per vehicle at Gigafactory Shanghai is less than half of what it is in the U.S.  We are expecting our upcoming factories such as Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas to  continue the same trend. \n",

As water that cools machinery evaporates, it needs to be topped up regularly. The total cooling  tower makeup could be offset entirely by non-potable sources such as rainwater or wastewater. These are some  of the initiatives we are taking at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and/or Gigafactory Texas in order to reduce  water consumption per complete vehicle (including cells). \n",
      "1. Water intensive process optimization: We are constantly looking into reducing water consumption by  optimizing or eliminating water intensive production processes across our operations. At Gigafactory Berlin- Brandenburg, we use hybrid cooling towers, have eliminated quench tanks in casting and introduced cascade  rinsing systems in the paint shop and battery can wash process for cell manufacturing. \n",
      "2. Rainwater and condensate harvesting and reuse: We are planning to capture at least 25% of roof runoff (1  million square feet) to a central underground storage system within Gigafactory Texas. Rainwater will be  recycled for use in the cooling of manufacturing equipment. In an average year, such systems should save an  estimated 7.5 million gallons of potable city water. Additionally, as hot, humid outdoor air is conditioned, water  condenses out of the air. Typically, this condensate is discarded as wastewater. At Gigafactory Texas, we reuse  this condensate in our cooling towers and process water systems to offset incoming site water. \n",
      "3. Reclaimed and recycled water (wastewater reuse): Using local treated wastewater could result in offsetting  the entire annual cooling tower makeup water demand with non-drinkable uses. At Gigafactory Texas, this could  result in an estimated 40 million gallons of potable city water conserved annually.

Tesla is also sharing  data and statistics collected by our vehicles with select regulatory bodies and external research organizations — in an anonymized fashion or with consent and in accordance with local data privacy laws — giving them access  to an unprecedented opportunity to understand crashes in the real world. This access to data will accelerate  impact safety research, driving change across the safety industry and improved safety outcomes for all vehicles  to protect lives. \n",

Since deployment of our ‘offzone’ side algorithm (data-driven  safety), we learned that of the total vehicles that had their airbags deployed, 15% of those deployed due to our  new algorithm in these new modes. This confirms our expectations and highlights how effective fleet-based  learnings and rapid deployment of novel solutions can be.  \n",

In 2021, Tesla sold 4 GWh worth of energy storage  products, more than 15% of the 25 GWh global market*. Some of these projects were massive deployments,  including a 371 MWh installation in California and a 497 MWh installation in Victoria, Australia.

Tesla creates our products  from many different materials and components, some of which we purchase from our direct (Tier 1) suppliers.  Many of our Tier 1 suppliers do not purchase all their raw materials directly, rather they get them from their  suppliers and sub-suppliers around the world through a complex supply chain. Though we believe that battery  recycling will play a critical role in supplying a portion of these materials to enable a closed loop supply chain,  we recognize that global battery cell production will continue to rely heavily on primary, mined materials to  meet the growing demand for our products. \n",

When petroleum is  pumped out of the ground, chemically refined and then burned, it releases toxic emissions into the atmosphere  that are not recoverable for reuse. Battery materials, in contrast, are refined and put into a cell and will remain in  the cell at the end of their life when they can be recycled to recover valuable materials for reuse, repeatedly. \n",

      "Battery pack life extension is the superior option to recycling for both environmental and business reasons.  Before decommissioning and recycling a consumer battery pack, Tesla does everything it can to extend the  useful life of each pack, including sending out over-the-air software updates to Tesla vehicles to improve battery  efficiency when our engineers find new ways to do so. In addition, any battery that is no longer meeting a  customer’s needs can be serviced at a Tesla Service Center. \n",

      "Tesla batteries, including the battery packs in our vehicles and our energy storage products, are made to last  many years, and therefore, we have received a limited number of them back from the field. Most batteries that  Tesla recycles today are pre-consumer, coming to us through R&D and quality control. None of our scrapped  lithium-ion batteries go to landfills and 100% are recycled. Furthermore, Tesla has an established internal  ecosystem to re-manufacture batteries coming from the field to our Service Centers. We actively implement  circular economy principles and consider all other options before opting for battery recycling. \n",

On-site recycling  brings us one step closer to closing the loop on materials generation, allowing for raw material transfer straight  to our nickel and cobalt suppliers. The facility unlocks the cycle of innovation for battery recycling at scale,  allowing Tesla to rapidly improve current designs through operational learnings and to perform process testing  of R&D products.

      "Given their unique significance to the success of EVs and energy storage, Tesla has a dedicated responsible  sourcing program for three priority minerals in the battery supply chain: cobalt, nickel and lithium. We prioritize  these raw materials for the following reasons: \n",
      "1. Commercial importance: Cobalt, lithium and nickel are the key raw materials used in cathode production,  represent about a third of the total costs of a battery cell and play an essential function in improving vehicle  range and safety performance. \n",
      "2. Potential environmental and social impact and scrutiny: Cobalt, lithium and nickel are also ‘minerals’ – in that  they are raw materials that are produced through different methods of mining around the world, often  concentrated in countries that face socio-economic and environmental challenges. As known global reserves  are depleted, these minerals are becoming increasingly scarce, and companies look to access resources in  more remote and challenging locations to meet global demand. Cobalt, lithium and nickel are also classified  as critical minerals by the United States, European Union and Canadian governments because they are  essential in enabling a transition away from fossil fuels to a low-carbon economy. As a result, the impact of  mining activity on the environment and local communities lends itself to greater environmental and social  scrutiny from civil society, policymakers and investors. \n",
      "Mining has an important role to play in the transition to sustainable energy and we engage with suppliers to  ensure mining is done in a responsible way. This is one of the reasons Tesla joined the Initiative for Responsible  Mining Assurance (IRMA) and uses the IRMA Standard as well as other internationally recognized responsible  mining standards in our due diligence. \n",

      "1. Direct sourcing from mining companies: While cobalt, nickel and lithium go through multiple processing  steps by different companies, some of the more important environmental and social risks in this supply chain  are present at mine sites. Direct sourcing from mining companies allows Tesla to engage directly in local  contexts instead of having to rely on multiple midstream companies that typically sit between EV makers  and mining. It also enables more transparent and traceable supply chains and better environmental and  social data. In 2021, Tesla procured >95% of lithium hydroxide, >50% of cobalt and >30% of nickel for nickel- containing (NCA and NCM) cells directly from nine mining and chemicals companies. All nine binding  contracts include environmental and social requirements. As Tesla’s battery supply chain continues to scale,  Tesla expects the proportion of directly sourced minerals to increase. \n",

Tesla will continue to advance a diversified cathode strategy for LFP, nickel-rich and  manganese-rich cathodes to address various market segments for vehicle and energy storage products and  provide future flexibility based on raw materials availability and pricing. To put this into context, lithium only  accounts for roughly 1.5% of the full battery pack weight. Additionally, iron phosphate battery packs contain no  cobalt or nickel.  \n",
      "While the relative cathode compositions and our overall demand of various minerals and battery-grade  chemicals will continue to evolve, Tesla and the global battery supply chain will require significant quantities of  responsibly produced lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese, iron, phosphates and many other minerals for the  foreseeable future. While we recognize the critical role battery recycling will play in supplying a portion of these  materials to enable a closed loop supply chain, global cell production will continue to rely heavily on primary,  mined materials to meet the growing demand in the short to medium term. The availability and affordability of  these minerals and chemicals are key to advancing Tesla’s mission and accelerating the transition to sustainable  energy. We will continue to collaborate with our suppliers and upstream producers in providing visibility to  enable the scale up of key battery minerals. \n",

This program extension  was introduced at the time when Tesla was transitioning from a small automotive manufacturer to a company  gaining recognition as the leader in electrical vehicle production. We recognized that this growth came with an  increased ability to impact positive change on the practices of our suppliers, but also with an increased  responsibility to drive such change in line with our mission statement. During the program pilot phase, we  focused our efforts on suppliers that we deemed high risk based on their industry or the use of potentially  dangerous processes and/or chemicals in the manufacturing of our parts. \n",
      "We chose to utilize the Responsible Business Alliance’s (RBA) Validated Assessment Program (VAP) as the  basis for our audits. The RBA’s VAP is an audit protocol globally recognized for its breadth of topics and  stringent requirements for supplier completion. It covers nearly 200 checkpoints across labor, health and safety,  environmental, ethical and management system topics. Audits are conducted by independent third parties that  are approved by the RBA, and all auditors must undergo training by the RBA on the audit standard and its  implementation ensuring a globally and industry-wide standardized approach. \n",
      "In any case where any priority non-conformance (the most significant type) occurs, our audit procedures  require that suppliers undergo a closure audit. These closure audits – which are a follow up to the original audit  where the non-conformances were identified – allow suppliers to address all non-conformances in the earlier  audits. Additional audits, rather than an immediate suspension of the business relationship, are preferred to  improve working conditions and reduce the risk of continued deficiencies. \n",
      "As of the end of 2021, we had a total of 152 supplier locations go through our supplier audit at least once,  representing 144 suppliers, or 10% of 2021 spend with our direct supply base. As part of these audits over 4,000  supplier employee interviews were conducted. \n",

While in its initial stages the suppliers subject to the audit were mainly located in China, and the  updated criteria expanded the scope to include significantly more suppliers globally. When we started our audit  program, we had only just announced our plans for Gigafactory Shanghai. We now have six factories across  three different continents, and our production volume of vehicles has grown exponentially. As our global  footprint and manufacturing grew, so did our supply base. Therefore, the expansion of our audit program was  an important step to ensure that our supplier due diligence efforts continue to reflect the realities of our supply  chain and can properly identify and address potential risks within our supply base. \n",
      "The criteria on which suppliers are selected to undergo the Supplier Audit is based on an expanded risk  assessment approach, looking at Tesla’s exposure to suppliers financially, as well as suppliers’ location. This  criteria determines which suppliers are obligated to undergo an audit, but additional suppliers can be  nominated by our commercial and supplier industrialization teams where they see value in doing so or the  potential to further mitigate risk. With the expanded audit program scope, we are targeting to cover over 50%  of our global spend with our direct supply base. \n",
      "As part of our program expansion, we are building on our ability to influence supplier behavior in a positive  way. When a supplier is not meeting our expectations, they are obligated to implement corrective action plans  to remedy any deficiencies or non-conformances found during the audit process, regardless of the severity. In  cases of the highest priority non-conformances, suppliers are required to undergo closure audits to ensure that  their corrective action plans have been fully implemented. In cases of less severe non-conformances, suppliers  are still required to develop and implement corrective action plans as well as provide evidence to Tesla that  those plans have been fully implemented within our expected timelines. \n",
      "Furthermore, we defined a separate category called Zero Tolerance Violations, which, for example, include any  violations related to the use of forced or child labor and inhumane treatment of workers. In cases where such  instances are discovered, our supply chain leadership will be informed, and a corrective action plan will be  developed immediately, together with the supplier. Tesla will transition away from the supplier relationship if the  supplier is unable or unwilling to correct the identified issues and improve their operations within a reasonable  time frame. \n",

For those that disclose their methodology we have found that vehicle life is often estimated to be as low  as 10 years and annual distance traveled by vehicles as low as 6,200 miles. This compares to an average life of 17  years in the U.S. (20 years in Europe) and 12,000 annual miles in the U.S. (and 7,450 in Europe).

      "2  Foreword on Impact  Current ESG evaluation  methodologies are  fundamentally flawed. To  achieve acutely-needed  change, ESG needs to  evolve to measure real- world Impact.  What ESG measures today: Investment Risk  Current environmental, social and governance (ESG)  reporting does not measure the scope of positive impact  on the world. Instead, it focuses on measuring the dollar  value of risk / return.  Individual investors – who entrust their money to ESG  funds of large investment institutions – are perhaps  unaware that their money can be used to buy shares of  companies that make climate change worse, not better.  An obvious example of this is measuring the impact of the  automotive industry. One might think that the more electric  vehicles an automaker sells, as a percentage of total  volumes, the better its ESG score. However, this is not the  case. As long as a company continues to slightly decrease  emissions of its manufacturing operations while churning  out gas-guzzlers, its ESG ratings are likely to go up.  Vehicle use-phase emissions, which represent 80-90% of  total automotive emissions (included in Scope 3 of ESG  reporting), tend to be misreported due to the use of  unrealistic assumptions or not reported at all.  It’s easy to see why some oil & gas companies rank higher  than Tesla on “Environmental Impact.”  “The most striking feature of the [ESG rating] system is  how rarely a company’s record on climate change seems to  get in the way of its climb up the ESG ladder—or even to  factor at all.”  ESG Mirage: Bloomberg Businessweek  What ESG needs to become: Company Impact  We need to create a system that measures and scrutinizes  actual positive impact on our planet, so unsuspecting  individual investors can choose to support companies that  can make and prioritize positive change.  On the product front, companies should be required to use  real-world data wherever remotely feasible and make it  clear when estimates are provided instead of real-world  figures. An example of this is vehicle “use-phase”  emissions, accounting for the vast majority of lifecycle  emissions. Automakers' estimates on lifetime vehicle  mileage and lifetime fuel consumption vary dramatically  and almost never reflect real-world data. Automakers often  have access to this data, but they don’t disclose it.  When it comes to a company’s employees, it is essential  that they’re treated well, with a system in place to prevent  discrimination of any kind, that they have a safe  workplace and that they are rewarded appropriately, with  significant upside if their employer does well.  Many ESG ratings evaluate: “Does this ESG issue impact the  profitability of the company?” We need a system that  evaluates: “Does the growth of this company have a  positive impact on the world?”  This evolution of ESG needs to be championed by  institutional investors, rating agencies, public companies  and the general public. As the world needs to strive for a  substantial positive impact, we won’t be referring to ESG in  this report. Instead, we’ll talk about Impact.  https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2021-what-is-esg-investing-msci-ratings-focus-on-corporate-bottom-line/  \n",
      "3  In 2021, the global fleet of Tesla vehicles, energy storage and solar panels  enabled our customers to avoid emitting 8.4 million metric tons of CO2e  The 6.8 million metric tons of vehicle CO2e savings estimate is based on the net CO2e savings during the use-phase of a Tesla vehicle compared to an ICE vehicle with a real-world fuel economy of  ~24 mpg (of which 0.9 million metric tons was avoided through annual renewables matching for the global Supercharger network and home charging in California). The 1.6 million metric tons of  solar + storage CO2e savings estimate is based on CO2e avoided through generation of zero-emission electricity from Tesla solar panels, including energy stored and later dispatched from our  energy storage products. Geographic distribution of our deliveries (both vehicle and solar), grid mix at the country, state and province level and upstream emissions are reflected in these figures.  \n",

      "7  Our Goals Tesla’s purpose is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.  We strive to be the best on every metric relevant to our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to  sustainable energy. To maximize our impact, we plan to continue increasing our production volumes and the  accessibility of our products. In more concrete terms, this means that by 2030 we are aiming to sell 20 million  electric vehicles per year (compared to 0.94 million in 2021) and deploy 1,500 GWh of energy storage per year  (compared to 4 GWh in 2021).  If we were to achieve such a vehicle delivery milestone through a consistent growth rate, the total Tesla vehicle  fleet would surpass tens of millions of vehicles by 2030, and each of those vehicles could save tons of CO2e  emissions every year of usage.  Furthermore, each product we make must be continuously improved at each step of its lifecycle: from  manufacturing to consumer use to recycling.  We must also improve every metric, including the energy and water used to make our products, how safe our  customers and employees are and the affordability and accessibility of our products. Each of these themes will  be covered in this year’s Impact Report.  \n",

It's at the  core of everything we do and is what motivates us in our work. It also matters greatly to our customers,  employees and shareholders. Our products and services are focused on transportation, energy production and  storage — each of which have traditionally been some of the biggest polluters both in the U.S. and globally.  To achieve a zero-emissions future, we continue to implement programs and initiatives at our global  manufacturing facilities and in our local communities.

      "9  Making an Impact Mission and the Tesla Ecosystem  Addressing climate change through an entire ecosystem  Climate change is reaching alarming levels globally due in large part to emissions from burning fossil fuels for  transportation and electricity generation. The world cannot reduce GHG emissions without addressing both  energy generation and consumption. And the world cannot address its energy habits without first directly  reducing emissions in the transportation and energy sectors.  We are designing and manufacturing a complete energy and transportation ecosystem. We both develop the  technology behind this ecosystem and focus on the affordability of the products that comprise it. We seek to  achieve this through our R&D and software development efforts as well as through our continuous drive to  develop advanced manufacturing capabilities.   \n",

      "\n",
      "1 1  Corporate Governance Introduction  Management involvement  At Tesla, sustainability is everyone's job regardless of their position, geographic location or title. Our  Sustainability Council, made up of leaders from across Tesla, collects data and prepares the analysis and  content of this report. The Sustainability Council also presents this information to Tesla’s Board of Directors for  review.  Board of Directors oversight  The Board of Directors serves as a prudent fiduciary for shareholders and oversees the management of Tesla’s  business — including reviewing the effectiveness of Tesla’s Impact priorities, initiatives and programs and this  report. With those responsibilities in mind, the Board sets high standards for Tesla and its employees, officers  and directors; and we periodically add new, highly qualified independent directors to the Board, such as Larry  Ellison and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson in 2018 and Hiromichi Mizuno in 2020. Implicit in this approach is the  importance of sound corporate governance.  \n",
      "\n",
      "1 2  Corporate Governance  Introduction  Sound corporate governance is critical to our mission. We are committed to establishing an operating  framework that exercises appropriate oversight of responsibilities at all levels throughout the company and  manages its affairs consistent with high principles of business ethics.  Tesla aspires to be a “do the right thing” company. Our Code of Business Ethics sets out basic principles that  should help anyone working at or for Tesla avoid even the appearance of improper behavior. Tesla’s Code of  Business Ethics and our Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on Tesla’s website.  In addition, we believe in regular and transparent communication with employees. We encourage Tesla  employees to share their feedback openly (and anonymously, if they prefer), and provide easy methods to do  so. We also regularly conduct employee surveys to identify strengths and opportunities for improvement. We  have a robust action planning process to ensure we proactively address the concerns or feedback.  We also have a whistleblower hotline through which employees can report concerns at any time. Tesla keeps  information reported by employees in confidence, whether through the hotline or another channel. Our policies  prohibit retaliatory actions against employees for raising concerns or making complaints. We are committed to  maintaining an open and transparent culture where it is safe and acceptable for all employees to raise concerns  about policy violations by their manager or colleagues or about the workplace overall.  http://ir.tesla.com/corporate-governance/highlights  \n",
      "1 3  Corporate Governance Our Approach  Our unique business requires a unique approach to corporate governance. And our mission requires a long-term  focus that we believe will ultimately maximize value to our employees and our stockholders. Our corporate  governance structure has facilitated several key decisions which might have appeared counter-intuitive to some,  but which have set up the Tesla to achieve long-term success. Some examples include our decisions to:  \n",
      "\n",
      "Manufacture all-electric vehicles (EVs) from the ground up rather than being a mere supplier of EV  components  \n",
      "\n",
      "Establish an international network of our own stores, service centers and Supercharger stations despite  regulatory hurdles and the significant capital outlay required to do so  \n",
      "\n",
      "Build Gigafactory 1, the largest lithium-ion battery factory in the world, so that we can scale most effectively  \n",
      "\n",
      "Expand into energy generation and storage through the acquisition of SolarCity Corporation in 2016 to  create a vertically integrated sustainable energy company and empower individual consumers to be their  own utility  \n",
      "\n",
      "Deploy FSD city streets beta software to our fleet to develop complete Full Self-Driving capability in the  future  \n",
      "\n",
      "Compensate our CEO only if other shareholders realize tremendous value  These and other similar decisions were made due to our corporate governance structure and, ultimately,  decisions like these are what differentiate Tesla from other companies and are a significant reason why the  annualized stockholder return since our 2010 IPO until December 31, 2021 equaled 65%. At the same time, the  Board continuously evaluates our corporate governance structure, practices and policies, and weighs  stakeholder feedback including proposals we have historically received at our annual meetings. For example, at  our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders, the Board proposed and recommended that stockholders adopt an  amendment to our certificate of incorporation to reduce the term of our directors to two years. However, our  stockholders did not approve that proposal.  The Board is directly and regularly engaged with senior management and the Sustainability Council and  participates in robust shareholder outreach and feedback. In addition, our directors have significant experience  as either top-level executives at public companies, as successful investors or as entrepreneurs who founded  successful organizations.  \n",

      "1 4  Committees of the Board  The Board has four standing committees — the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the  Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Disclosure Controls Committee — which are each  further described in the following pages. Each member of these committees qualifies as an independent  director under the listing standards of NASDAQ. In addition, as part of our governance review and succession  planning, the Board (led by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee) evaluates our leadership  structure to ensure that it remains the optimal structure for Tesla, reviews the composition, size and  performance of the Board and its committees, evaluates individual directors and identifies and evaluates  candidates for election or re-election to the Board. Committee charters were updated in 2021 to reflect the  growing risks and opportunities around ESG.  Board role in risk oversight  The Board is responsible for overseeing the major risks facing Tesla, while management is responsible for  assessing and mitigating Tesla’s risks on a day-to-day basis. In addition, the Board has delegated oversight of  certain categories of risk to its independent committees, which then report to the Board, as appropriate, on  matters that involve the specific areas of risk that each committee oversees.

      "1 6  Our compensation philosophy reflects our long-term mission and our startup origins. We emphasize structuring  compensation to reward our named executive officers based on performance, and equity awards weigh heavily  in our named executive officers’ total compensation, including awards that vest upon the achievement of clear  and measurable milestones. Since these awards increase in value as our stock price increases (and in the case of  stock option awards, have no value unless our stock price increases following their grant), our named executive  officers’ incentives are closely aligned with the long-term interests of our stockholders.  Tesla has no cash bonus program for any of our named executive officers and generally does not provide any  perquisites or tax reimbursements to our named executive officers that are not available to other employees. No  named executive officer has any severance or change of control arrangement, except as reflected in Elon Musk’s  performance-based 2018 CEO Performance Award.  A change in control modifies the vesting requirements of  the 2018 CEO Performance Award such that vesting of the Award’s tranches would be measured based on  Tesla’s market capitalization at the time of the change of the control, without regard to the operational  milestones of the Award. Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, historically earned a base salary that reflected  the applicable minimum wage requirements under California law, and he was subject to income taxes based on  such base salary. However, he has never accepted his salary. Commencing in May 2019 at Mr. Musk’s request, we  eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of this base salary. Consequently, 100% of Mr. Musk’s  compensation is at-risk.  Similarly, the compensation program for Tesla’s non-employee directors is designed to be consistent with our  compensation philosophy for our employees, with an emphasis on equity-based compensation over cash in  order to align the value of their compensation with the market value of our stock, and consequently, with the  long-term interests of our stockholders. Moreover, while we offer to our general employee population restricted  stock units that will retain some value even if the market value of our stock decreases, the equity-based  compensation to our directors has been exclusively in the form of stock options, which have zero initial value  and accumulate value, if at all, only to the extent that our stock price increases following their grant, through  the applicable vesting dates and until such stock options are ultimately exercised and the underlying shares are  sold. The remaining portion of our directors’ compensation has been comprised of cash retainer payments that  are relatively modest compared to peer companies and that may be waived at the election of each  director. Further, in June 2021, the Board adopted a resolution that all existing directors forego any automatic  grants of annual stock option awards under our director compensation policy until July 2022 unless the Board  determines otherwise.

For Tesla vehicles,  customer personal data is protected from the moment they take delivery, ensuring that by default the vehicle  data generated when driving is not associated with the customer's account or vehicle identification number.  Tesla also puts customers in the driver’s seat when it comes to data sharing by providing a dedicated in-vehicle  menu to adjust preferences at any time.  Additionally, from Powerwall to Solar Roof, energy products are designed to protect customer privacy. Tesla  aims to collect a minimum amount of personal data necessary in providing the most engaging in-app energy  experience. In furtherance of transparency, Tesla has developed a seamless way for customers to download and  access their energy data at any time right from the Tesla app.  Engaging the security community  We are also focused on ensuring that our vehicles are the most secure on the road. To do that, our team of  world-class engineers works day in and day out to ensure that our systems are always as secure as possible.  And while some of the best security engineers work at Tesla, we believe that in order to design and build  inherently secure systems, we cannot work alone. We work closely with the security research community to  benefit from their collective expertise and diversity of thought.  Continuous product improvement  Tesla pioneered the concept of vehicles that improve and become more capable over time by ensuring that  every Tesla vehicle made since 2012 can accept over-the-air (OTA) software updates. These updates have  introduced new features and functionality that have made our vehicles smarter, safer and more enjoyable to  drive. We have also used the OTA system to ensure that our vehicles are not only as secure as possible when  they are delivered, but that they continue to stay as secure as possible throughout their lifetime.

While  share prices will remain volatile and past performance is not indicative of future results, stock-based  compensation brings shared ownership to the workforce, and our employees are encouraged to make a positive  change for the benefit of all. Culturally, shared ownership of the company is one of the most essential attributes  of working at Tesla.   For example, assume that an employee received a grant of 320 Tesla shares in 2018 that vested 20 shares  quarterly over 16 quarters (4 years). Based on the stock price at the time of the grant, the quarterly vest of 20  Tesla shares would equate to $1,331-worth of sellable shares at the end of 2018. However, the same vest two  years later would equate to $14,113-worth of sellable shares per quarter based on the increase in the price per  share of Tesla stock over that period. Employees are also eligible to buy additional stock at a discount through  the Employee Stock Purchase Program.

Our early years of Model 3 production and global expansion were some of  the most difficult in our history and our employee satisfaction ratings (Glassdoor) reflected that.  Our company is in a different phase now. Model 3 has become the best-selling premium sedan globally and  profitability (operating margin) rose to the highest in the industry. This has fueled our ability to expand  dramatically and provide career opportunities for many strong performers. Compensation, linked to the  performance of the company, also improved substantially in recent years.   There’s still a lot of work to be done, predominantly when it comes to work-life balance. Our goals have always  been, and still are, bold. Expectations are understandably high as a result. We recently introduced unlimited  vacation for salaried employees and added more family benefits. Both Glassdoor rankings as well as our internal  data show that our employees are becoming happier as a result of our growing success as well as our expanded  employee benefit programs.

As nearly 70% of our leadership is promoted from within Tesla, our employees are surrounded by examples of  successful progression. Our global headcount increased by over 40% in 2021.

      "3 5  Integrating Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) principles and practices into the DNA of our company  In 2020, we instituted quarterly diversity data reviews across different divisions. These ensure that we identify  trends across functions instead of simply looking at our workforce at the company-wide level. Executives review  organizational demographics and work with their DEI, HR and Recruiting partners to create an action plan to  attract, develop and retain talent.  That same year, we also took steps to incorporate DEI principles into talent management. The fundamental pillar  in this strategy is consistent and fair performance reviews — a reliable review process leads to more equitable  access to internal opportunities. Since 2020, we have routinely delivered performance reviews to over 99% of all  employees globally. The program has led to improvements in our internal mobility program and employees'  access to career opportunities within Tesla.  We expanded our leadership development team with a focus on providing DEI offerings to all our U.S.  employees. Now all employees are introduced to our DEI principles on their first day as part of orientation and  can continue their DEI learning journey throughout their time at Tesla. From our allyship resources, to DEI Life  Hacks on our DEI Knowledge Center, to virtual instructor led courses on unconscious bias, inclusive interviewing  and inclusive leadership, our employees have access to information no matter where they are.  Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion principles  Our DEI team uses a people-first and data-driven approach to champion diversity, equity and inclusion in our  business and in the communities in which we operate.

This is a large percentage,  considering that just 0.3% of our employees are director level and above at Tesla.  We are working to increase minority representation in professional and management categories through our  intentional recruiting efforts with Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions,  activations at the National Society of Black Engineers, the Society of Hispanic Engineers, AfroTech, as well as  community partnerships with organizations like College Track and Black Girls Code.

As a result, we do not tolerate discrimination, harassment or any  mistreatment of employees in the workplace or work-related situations. Below are some of the actions we are  taking to ensure the proper treatment of all employees.  Training: Code of Business Ethics and harassment & discrimination training for front-line leaders, HR partners  and other employees to understand how to create and promote a respectful workplace, assess situations sooner  and escalate appropriately.  Internal Tracking System Enhancement: An enhancement to our internal tracking system now allows HR to  document all employee concerns that are raised to ensure there is follow through and resolution for tracking  purposes. Additionally, handling concerns at the initial stage helps prevent them from becoming bigger issues.  The case management system also allows the appropriate teams to review data to trend and issue spot, which  then can lead to proactive solutions before concerns arise.  Internal Mobility: A program that advocates for and provides equal access to employee advancement  opportunities and retention with eligibility for opportunities based on standardized performance reviews.  Opportunities are advertised on an internal site with career resources in addition to a monthly newsletter. We  also offer 1-on-1 support and personal consultations to understand the career aspirations of internal applicants.  Third-party managed integrity line  We encourage employees to raise concerns internally or externally. An employee can raise concerns or  complaints to any member of management, Human Resources or Employee Relations (ER). If they prefer to  report another way, the Integrity Line is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The Integrity Line allows  employees to report concerns anonymously and without fear of retaliation.  If any employee raises a good faith concern, HR, together with ER, will ensure that employee concerns are  investigated promptly and impartially in a manner appropriate to the circumstances.

When we feel  connected to the Tesla community and mission, we unlock our full potential as a workforce.  What we are doing to keep employees engaged  To promote engagement, we lead initiatives driven by employee feedback. Throughout the year, we use  roundtables, engagement surveys and other feedback forms to gather data and better understand the  employee experience.  Our team uses this data to inform our communication strategies. In addition to a monthly newsletter emailed to  all U.S. employees and physically posted at manufacturing sites, we launched a new company-wide internal  news platform with weekly updates on company news, employee recognition and events.  We highlight business, people and safety updates via both email and an expansive network of video screens. In  2021, we also produced two live and virtual companywide all-hands.  These channels pair with the revitalization of daily Start-Up meetings for assembly workers to streamline  communications across the Fremont Factory. HR members also staff on-site Answer Bar kiosks to address  employee questions and concerns at many of our office locations.  Engagement requires making resources more accessible. This translates to regular on-site tabling and fairs for  benefits, as well as making information available digitally.

In March 2022, Tesla employees in Europe volunteered to design, prototype and deploy the first 50 kits  containing Powerwalls, Gateways and solar inverters to support continued energy access in Ukraine. When  paired with one of the 250 solar panels dispatched by volunteers at Gigafactory Berlin, these mini power plants  can assist Ukrainian communications and essential services indefinitely by using solar to recharge Powerwalls.  Along with Starlink Terminals used for satellite internet access (made by SpaceX), the kits were shipped to the  Ukranian border in Poland, at which point they were transferred onto military trucks. The kit can begin providing  power almost instantly, without any tools or technical experience required. With the Powerwall kit alone, a user  can power Starlink for five days. With solar panels installed and operational, the kits can provide indefinite  power for Starlink Terminal, plus a small appliance or laptop.  Surrounding European countries  In addition to product donations, Tesla has opened free Supercharging at all stations in Poland, Slovakia and  Hungary to support those impacted by the recent events.

We deployed 14 systems to over 10 sites, including food distribution centers, churches, a  warehouse, a fire station, a shelter and command center for NGOs. Most systems stayed in place for six weeks  while the grid was down; in cases where the building was too damaged to return power after the grid was back  up the systems remained in place for substantially longer. Our partners estimate that these systems provided  power to over 1,000 people including recovery workers, food distribution volunteers and first responders.  Kentucky Storms  After the Kentucky winter storms, we deployed two systems at a research and education center in Princeton,  Kentucky in partnership with the Footprint Project. These systems helped power communications trailers and  mobile offices for over 50 recovery workers. They are still deployed while the center is being rebuilt and we are  exploring ways to turn the trailers and mobile offices into a training center for future recovery workers.  Texas Winter Storm  In February 2021, Texas experienced a weather event that caused the widespread loss of power for several days  affecting thousands of residents. Tesla provided a disaster relief system to Pathways Youth & Family Services,  Inc., a non-profit social service organization providing foster care, adoption and behavioral health services to  communities across Texas. The system consisted of four mobile Powerwall units (for a total of ~100kWh of  batteries and 40kW of power). With this system, Pathways was able to restore heat and power to its facilities,  enabling it to resume housing and other social services to children.  \n",

We were able to  improve our performance in Environmental, Health, Safety and Security (EHS&S) by turning to the experts in  Tesla – our own employees. We evolved the way we define safety, developed internal tools to drive execution,  actively sought worker improvement suggestions and established a more structured EHS&S audit program to  identify safeguards and drive operational excellence throughout all areas of the business.  Our EHS&S strategy remains focused on three pillars:  1. Do the Basics Right | 2. Engage and Empower Our Stakeholders | 3. Reduce Risk  Changing how we define safety and build capacity: Human and Organizational Performance (HOP) and  Operational Learning  As we grew and evolved as an EHS&S organization, so did our view of safety. The Human and Organizational  Performance (HOP) and Operational Learning group was developed in 2021 to integrate our new view of safety  into the organization.  In an ever-changing and dynamic work environment, we recognized the need to focus on creating the ability to  fail safely. Creating the ability to fail safely is comprised of three components:  1. Engaged workers: workers who are connected to and care about the work they do. When workers are  engaged, they are more likely to identify and communicate vulnerabilities in the system.  2. Agility: the ability to continuously navigate and adapt in an ever-changing, complex and dynamic work  environment.  3. Safeguards: the hardware, software and human actions that directly prevent an event or mitigate a bad  outcome.  Instead of defining safety as the absence of accidents, we define safety as the presence of capacity. Capacity  can be defined as the ability to mitigate outcomes and reduce system brittleness.

In response to that need, we  developed an internal EHS&S tool named MyEHS to help drive execution and improve outcomes by allowing the  intake and visualization of data globally. We designed and deployed 11 modules in 2021, allowing us to better  manage our EHS&S information, identify emerging risks and take action to implement improvements suggested  by our employees.  Foremost in this effort was our improvement suggestion module — Take Charge. Combined with Action Tracker,  this module allows workers to submit improvement suggestions in various categories, including environment,  health, safety, security, people and accuracy, while connecting with their supervisors and other work groups to  identify and implement solutions to improve the presence of safeguards.  Take Charge case study — Sherry Ihrig  Leading the way with Take Charge submissions is Sherry Ihrig, with over 1,800 improvement suggestions to  safety, processes, cost-savings and more since the program’s start in early 2021.  “Tesla promotes the concept that ‘safety is a shared responsibility,’ and the Take Charge program truly  empowers me to take a more active role in sharing that responsibility,” Ihrig said.  “The Take Charge program encourages associates to increase their awareness of the work environment,” Ihrig said. “When these and other potential safety hazards are noticed and resolved, it allows associates to improve  their overall work performance.”  While Ihrig has enjoyed many parts of her experience at Tesla, from teaming up with “hardworking, outgoing  individuals” to learning how to operate a fire extinguisher in emergency response training, the most exciting  part has been the Take Charge program.

      "56  Introduction What Do We See As Impact?  The biggest environmental impact is achieved through early displacement of ICE vehicles and replacing them  with EVs. Additionally, we want to displace fossil-based energy generation with renewable energy generation.   As of the end of 2021, Tesla (including SolarCity prior to its 2016 acquisition by Tesla) has installed almost 4.0  Gigawatts of solar systems and cumulatively generated over 25.0 Terawatt-hours (TWhs) of emissions-free  electricity. For reference, that is more energy generated by our installations than the total energy Tesla has used  to run all our factories since we began producing Model S in 2012 and electricity used to power all of our  vehicles in that same period combined.  We are striving to always remain a net contributor to renewable energy generation. It is our goal to eventually  have all our manufacturing energy needs satisfied through renewable sources where possible. Additionally, we  are hoping to see more Tesla vehicle customers installing solar panels or Solar Roof along with a Powerwall to  meet their own energy needs in a sustainable way.

      "57  Introduction In addition to an updated Lifecycle Analysis (LCA) for Model 3 and Model Y, we are reporting total Scope 1 and  Scope 2 emissions and use-phase emissions of our vehicles  In this year’s report we are reporting our Scope 1 (direct emissions from our facilities) and Scope 2 (purchased  electricity, heat, etc. for our facilities) emissions resulting from global operations. This information is not only  important to benchmark our performance against other manufacturers but is also the first step to track  progress as we continue to work to decarbonize our own operations. While the most important work we can do  to reduce GHG emissions is through selling as many of our products as possible, we are also committed to  reducing carbon emitted from our own operations longer term. This is not only the right thing to do, but it also  makes business sense as we reduce the resource intensity of our processes.   It is possible to fully decarbonize the manufacturing and use of EVs – this is economically unfeasible for ICE  vehicles  We are often asked if electric vehicles (EVs) are more sustainable than internal combustion engine (ICE)  vehicles. The environmental impact of zero-emission transport and energy products, like the products that Tesla  produces and sells, is undeniably more positive than the GHG-emitting alternatives. This becomes more  pronounced when determining the lifetime impact of EVs versus ICE vehicles, which requires looking at the  entire lifecycle — from raw materials to use-phase emissions to disposal — and not just at vehicle usage  emissions.

Using only real-world data, not official NEDC, WLPT or EPA1 consumption data  The most important variable in a lifecycle analysis of an automobile is real-world fuel consumption or electricity  consumption, as applicable, which impacts the use-phase of the lifecycle. Various efficiency testing cycles such  as NEDC, WLTP or EPA do not truly represent real-world fuel or energy consumption. Therefore, we used:   EV energy consumption: Real world energy consumption based on 25 billion miles traveled Tesla Model 3 and  Model Y vehicles, including energy losses during the charging process.   ICE fuel consumption: Data provided by Consumer Reports, which reports model year 2020 mid-size premium  sedans achieve 24.3 MPG on average. This translates to over 400 grams of CO2e per mile once we account for  emissions generated through the extraction, refining and shipment of oil.  The carbon impact of ICE vehicles remains the same every year of use, but for EVs, it should improve every year  Based on publicly available sales and fleet data, we estimate that an average vehicle in the U.S. is driven slightly  less than 12,000 miles per year for about 17 years before it is scrapped. Furthermore, as an ICE vehicle ages, its  fuel efficiency only remains stable if serviced properly. On the other hand, electricity generation to charge EVs  has become “greener” over time with the addition of cleaner energy sources to the grid. Below, we show zero- emission electricity generation capacity (including nuclear) in the U.S. since 2015. Even without factoring in any  changes to federal policy or an acceleration of the adoption of renewables in the U.S. (which is likely), if current  trends remain stable, emissions generated through EV charging should continue to decline over time.  1NEDC = New European Driving Cycle; WLPT = Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure; EPA = U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 22021-2040 Tesla estimate based on recent grid mix shifts.

That said, even in this scenario, charging a Tesla Model 3Y from  the grid is still less emission intensive than running an ICE vehicle. Just like in Europe, we have assumed a  vehicle lifetime of 150,000 miles.  We are expecting the grid mix in China to improve dramatically over time as China remains a dominant deployer  and manufacturer of renewable energy. Sichuan Province (with a population of 81 million) is a great example of  this. In this province, given the high percentage of renewable energy penetration, charging an EV from the grid  is less polluting than charging an EV in most global countries or states.  In conclusion, even as of 2021, charging a Tesla Model 3Y in any of our major markets is more environmentally  friendly than burning gasoline.

Many of the projects created to achieve this goal were showcased at our  Battery Day presentation in September 2020.  4.

Current electrode production processes involve mixing liquids with cathode or anode powders and  using massive machinery to coat and dry the electrode. Since this process involves large ovens, today’s cell  production consumes a lot of energy.

Creating a battery that  could last for 1,000,000 miles (4,000 charging cycles) would dramatically reduce the emissions per mile driven  for high-mileage vehicles such as taxis, delivery vans or trucks.  Producing Robotaxis is a core part of our mission. All vehicles in the world combined travel trillions of miles  every year. A relatively small number of vehicles, such as taxis, delivery vans, trucks and buses account for a  disproportionate amount of vehicle miles and, as a result, a disproportionate amount of emissions. A single  future Tesla vehicle with a million-mile battery could be utilized over five-times more than an average vehicle in  the U.S. After being fully optimized, and even once it is scrapped, a battery can still be recycled and its  materials used in a brand-new battery.  Reducing Carbon Footprint Even Further Increasing Vehicle Utilization  Note: Mileage is only one factor in battery capacity retention; battery age is also a major factor. Retention figures at lower mileages above likely  reflect the impact of age while higher mileage values, which come from high-utilization vehicles, likely reflect less influence from battery age.

      "6 9  Scope 3 GHG emissions calculations are highly academic, even those widely used and accepted like the GHG  Protocol. Most companies lack primary data as it relates to their supply chain, product use and so on. Therefore,  most Scope 3 GHG emissions reporting is done using lofty assumptions as well as estimates from databases – this can lead to figures that are magnitudes off from the actual impact. Tesla has begun to measure the two  largest categories within our Scope 3 emissions: those from use of product and our supply chain.  Use of product emissions  Tesla has access to primary data from our over two million vehicles on the road and our fleet of solar and  storage products — we can calculate our emissions at a much higher level of accuracy than most manufactures  and can therefore develop emissions reduction solutions to match. This also means that we can calculate our use  of product emissions year on year — we do not have to estimate emissions over the lifetime of the vehicle  because we have primary data.  Supply chain emissions  Prioritizing our supply chain is crucial and we have a lot of work to do to incentivize suppliers to provide energy  and emissions data for us to report on. We have already started to identify which materials and processes in our  supply chain are key emitters so we can prioritize engagement and projects to address these emissions — see  the Supply Chain section for more detail.  The good thing for us is that Tesla’s high level of vertical integration and our direct sourcing relationships mean  we are positioned to manage upstream emissions better than most.  100% Renewable Supercharger network  Efficiency of an ICE vehicle does not improve throughout its lifetime. EVs will get cleaner over their lifetime as  the grid becomes greener. We will continue to look for ways to enable our customers to further reduce their  emissions beyond our vehicles — through solar and storage products and software to help differentiate when the  grid is greener and pulling more renewable energy like solar or wind.  The global Supercharger network was 100% renewable in 2021, achieved through a combination of onsite  resources and annual renewable matching. Additionally, all home charging in California was 100% renewable  through annual renewable matching.

Payload equal to a diesel truck  With both the U.S. and E.U. having approved higher weight allowances for electric heavy-duty trucks, we expect  the payload to be at least as high as it would be for a diesel truck. In the E.U., electric semi trucks are allowed to  be 2 tons (~4,400 pounds) heavier than diesel equivalents, and in the U.S. the allowance is 0.9 tons (2,000  pounds). When fully loaded, the Tesla Semi should be able to achieve over 500 miles of range, achieved through  aerodynamics and highly efficient motors. This truck will be able to reach an efficiency of over 0.5 miles per  kWh.  While most heavy trucking journeys are shorter than 500 miles, we want long-distance hauling to also be  sustainable.

First, because the automotive  supply chain doesn’t have a strong presence on the West Coast of the U.S., many components need to be  shipped from long distances, requiring excessive packaging and creating more waste than necessary.  Second, modern factories are better designed for material flow. Trailer entry points surround the whole factory,  which means that components can be offloaded precisely at the part of the factory where they are needed. Less  material flow results in less waste, because a shorter journey requires less protective packaging.

That is why we are reducing our water usage  throughout our operations as much as possible. We have prioritized direct use in manufacturing and will  continue to explore the rest of our impact throughout the supply chain and in sales, service and delivery.  The “cooling tower makeup” is the single biggest contributor to water usage in any car factory after paint  operations. As water that cools machinery evaporates, it needs to be topped up regularly. The total cooling  tower makeup could be offset entirely by non-potable sources such as rainwater or wastewater. These are some  of the initiatives we are taking at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and/or Gigafactory Texas in order to reduce  water consumption per complete vehicle (including cells).  1. Water intensive process optimization: We are constantly looking into reducing water consumption by  optimizing or eliminating water intensive production processes across our operations. At Gigafactory Berlin- Brandenburg, we use hybrid cooling towers, have eliminated quench tanks in casting and introduced cascade  rinsing systems in the paint shop and battery can wash process for cell manufacturing.  2. Rainwater and condensate harvesting and reuse: We are planning to capture at least 25% of roof runoff (1  million square feet) to a central underground storage system within Gigafactory Texas. Rainwater will be  recycled for use in the cooling of manufacturing equipment. In an average year, such systems should save an  estimated 7.5 million gallons of potable city water. Additionally, as hot, humid outdoor air is conditioned, water  condenses out of the air. Typically, this condensate is discarded as wastewater. At Gigafactory Texas, we reuse  this condensate in our cooling towers and process water systems to offset incoming site water.  3. Reclaimed and recycled water (wastewater reuse): Using local treated wastewater could result in offsetting  the entire annual cooling tower makeup water demand with non-drinkable uses. At Gigafactory Texas, this could  result in an estimated 40 million gallons of potable city water conserved annually.

While it is common practice today for ICE vehicle OEMs to purchase regulatory credits from other  companies (such as Tesla) to offset their total GHG emissions, it is not a sustainable strategy. In order to meet  increasingly strict regulatory requirements across the world, OEMs will be forced to develop truly competitive  EVs.

      "7 9  Vehicle Usage EVs as the Primary Vehicle  Customers are using their Tesla as their main car  For an EV to have an impact on the environment, it must be genuinely displacing internal combustion engine  miles, rather than sitting in the driveway as a secondary car used for errands or short trips only. Our data shows  that Tesla vehicles are being driven more than average vehicles in the U.S., suggesting that they are generally  being used as a customer’s primary vehicle. We fundamentally believe that you shouldn’t have to choose  between price, quality, usability and sustainability. An EV should be the best vehicle in every way, so consumers  don’t ever need to use ICE vehicles.  The longer the range, the higher the usage  There is a clear relationship between range, how often an EV is utilized and whether it is a primary-use vehicle.  The more confident owners are that their EV can be used for commuting, errands and long road trips, the less  they will feel they need to supplement their EV with an ICE vehicle. Surveys consistently indicate that the real or  perceived lack of EV range is the key reason why many people do not consider replacing their ICE vehicle with  an EV.  0 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,000 10,000 12,000  Avg.

      "8 0  Freedom of travel is the reason people buy vehicles in the first place. To ensure we replace as many ICE vehicles  with EVs as possible, we have been focused on increasing the range of Tesla vehicles. While most personal  vehicle journeys are relatively short, and thus drivable on a single charge, consumers do not buy cars that can  meet most of their driving needs; they buy a car that meets all their driving needs.  The longer the range, the lower the Supercharger use  Since its introduction in 2012, we have increased the range of the Model S by over 50%: from 265 miles to 405  miles of range for the long-range version. Our focus on energy efficiency — achieving superior range from the  same size battery — has allowed to us continue to increase range while keeping the battery size relatively  stable. Our data shows that the longer the range of our vehicles, the less Supercharging Tesla customers do.  After all, day trips of over 400 miles are quite rare.  Super-fast charging: V3 Superchargers can increase range by up to 200 miles in just 15 minutes  Around 300 miles of range at highway speeds is equal to roughly four hours of driving. At that stage, drivers  are often likely to take a break. We want to make sure that such a break can be relatively short before  continuing the journey. Our latest generation of Superchargers can recover up to 200 miles of range in just 15  minutes of charging, long enough for a quick break and snack.  Substantial coverage and 99.96% reliability  We’re aware that the chart showing Supercharger uptime looks silly, but that’s kind of the point. While coverage  is important, uptime is essential. Few things are as frustrating as arriving to a charging station with a near- empty battery, realizing that none of the charging plugs are working. In 2021 alone, we opened 912 new  Supercharger locations around the world for a total of nearly 3,500 charging locations with over 31,000 plugs.   1Uptime of Supercharger sites reflects the average percentage of sites globally that had at least 50% daily capacity functional for the year.  99.0%  99.5%  100.0%  2018 2019 2020 2021  Uptime of Supercharger Sites1  Vehicle Usage Long-Distance Travel  \n",

      "8 3  Our commitment to safety is why all Tesla vehicles built since October 2016 come with a suite of external  cameras, additional sensors and onboard computing that enable advanced safety features like Automatic  Emergency Braking, Lane Departure Warning, Forward and Side Collision Warning, Obstacle-Aware  Acceleration, blind spot warnings and more — all of which continue to improve over time through software  updates. We recently introduced active safety features that go beyond the norm:  Traffic Light & Stop Sign Warning  When a driver doesn’t notice a red light or a stop sign, our cars will notice that vehicle’s speed is too high.  Thanks to our eight-camera system, each vehicle can recognize a traffic light that is specific to vehicle’s  trajectory as well as a stop sign. A loud warning is triggered to alert the driver.  Pedal Misapplication Mitigation (accelerator pressed inadvertently)  Pressing the accelerator pedal when the circumstances indicate you should be pressing the brake instead, like  when pulling into a parking space, is relatively common no matter what vehicle you're in. However, if you are in  a Tesla, when our cameras recognize an object in front of the car, “Pedal Misapplication Mitigation” system cuts  torque from the electric motor to prevent a collision if you happen to press hard on the accelerator. This  technology has prevented or mitigated hundreds of collisions every month.  Active avoidance of lane departure or a blind-spot collision  If a driver is changing into a lane while a vehicle in the blind spot is entering the same lane, or if our vehicle  starts departing its lane without an indicator, our vehicles will sound a warning and assist the steering to avoid a  collision.

      "8 7  Changing How Vehicles Are Designed For Safety  We use field data, data analytics and simulations to inform our design and safety engineers’ work on future  products and to send software improvements to our existing fleet via over-the-air updates. Tesla is also sharing  data and statistics collected by our vehicles with select regulatory bodies and external research organizations — in an anonymized fashion or with consent and in accordance with local data privacy laws — giving them access  to an unprecedented opportunity to understand crashes in the real world. This access to data will accelerate  impact safety research, driving change across the safety industry and improved safety outcomes for all vehicles  to protect lives.  Post-Crash Data Analysis  After we send new software to the fleet, we wait for new data to come through to understand the efficacy of  the system once it is deployed in the real world. Since deployment of our ‘offzone’ side algorithm (data-driven  safety), we learned that of the total vehicles that had their airbags deployed, 15% of those deployed due to our  new algorithm in these new modes. This confirms our expectations and highlights how effective fleet-based  learnings and rapid deployment of novel solutions can be.   Why Airbags Sometimes Don’t Deploy  In a fairly common “small overlap” collision as the one shown below, front sensors are unlikely to pick up a side  collision, as they are usually designed to detect a frontal collision. And side sensors are usually too close to a  driver window to detect a collision far in the front. We designed our sensors and their positions in a way that  they can pick up nearly every type of collision and deploy airbags if necessary.

Added benefit of enhanced performance  Based on the advanced architecture of Model S and Model X, we engineered Model 3 and Model Y to be some  of the safest cars built to date, anywhere. Even though Model 3 and Model Y have no engine, their performance  is similar to a “mid-engine internal combustion car” due to a centered battery pack and the fact that the rear  motor is placed slightly in front of the rear axle rather than behind it. Not only does this architecture add to the  overall agility and handling of the car, but it also improves stability control effectiveness by minimizing  rotational kinetic energy.

In theory, all U.S. domestic electricity needs, as well as vehicle transportation needs, could be met by sunlight  alone. Naturally, installation of such a system needs to make financial sense for the customer. In Massachusetts,  for example, we estimate that an average solar and storage system pays for itself with energy cost savings  within approximately 10 years.

      "9 5  What do we see as impact?  Protecting human rights and the environment is core to our procurement strategy. Tesla creates our products  from many different materials and components, some of which we purchase from our direct (Tier 1) suppliers.  Many of our Tier 1 suppliers do not purchase all their raw materials directly, rather they get them from their  suppliers and sub-suppliers around the world through a complex supply chain. Though we believe that battery  recycling will play a critical role in supplying a portion of these materials to enable a closed loop supply chain,  we recognize that global battery cell production will continue to rely heavily on primary, mined materials to  meet the growing demand for our products.  In line with our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy, Tesla is committed to ensuring  that companies in our supply chain respect human rights and protect the environment. Our goal is that where  Tesla’s supply chain touches, local conditions for stakeholders continuously improve as a result of our  purchases. Our responsible sourcing strategy has the following objectives:  1. Increase the share of materials we source directly from suppliers, and those closer to our factories  (supply chain localization); and    2. Continue to source globally, to contribute to the improvement of local conditions in our sourcing  communities.   Mapping GHG emissions in the battery supply chain is one of our top priorities  Upstream GHG emissions from manufacturing an EV battery – from raw material extraction through refining and  transportation of materials – can be meaningful. We estimate that these specific activities cause up to ~80% of  the total emissions of a Model 3 battery pack, with the largest contributors at the chemical processing stage.

      "9 6  Extracting raw  materials  A common question we receive is: “What happens to Tesla battery packs once they reach the end of their life?”  An important distinction between fossil fuels and lithium-ion batteries as an energy source is that while fossil  fuels are extracted and used once, the materials in a lithium-ion battery are recyclable. When petroleum is  pumped out of the ground, chemically refined and then burned, it releases toxic emissions into the atmosphere  that are not recoverable for reuse. Battery materials, in contrast, are refined and put into a cell and will remain in  the cell at the end of their life when they can be recycled to recover valuable materials for reuse, repeatedly.  Longer battery longevity is the most sustainable option  Battery pack life extension is the superior option to recycling for both environmental and business reasons.  Before decommissioning and recycling a consumer battery pack, Tesla does everything it can to extend the  useful life of each pack, including sending out over-the-air software updates to Tesla vehicles to improve battery  efficiency when our engineers find new ways to do so. In addition, any battery that is no longer meeting a  customer’s needs can be serviced at a Tesla Service Center.  Every battery used in R&D or returned from the field that cannot be re-manufactured is recycled  Tesla batteries, including the battery packs in our vehicles and our energy storage products, are made to last  many years, and therefore, we have received a limited number of them back from the field. Most batteries that  Tesla recycles today are pre-consumer, coming to us through R&D and quality control. None of our scrapped  lithium-ion batteries go to landfills and 100% are recycled. Furthermore, Tesla has an established internal  ecosystem to re-manufacture batteries coming from the field to our Service Centers. We actively implement  circular economy principles and consider all other options before opting for battery recycling.  The small number of post-consumer batteries that we receive are primarily generated from our fleet of vehicles  on the road, predominantly from taxi-like vehicles. Since we have only been producing Model S (our oldest  model) for approximately ten years, and our energy storage products for even less time, it will likely be some  time before we start receiving back vehicle batteries in larger volumes.

While Tesla has worked for  years with third-party battery recyclers to ensure our batteries do not end up in a landfill, we understand the  importance of also building recycling capacity in-house to supplement these relationships. On-site recycling  brings us one step closer to closing the loop on materials generation, allowing for raw material transfer straight  to our nickel and cobalt suppliers. The facility unlocks the cycle of innovation for battery recycling at scale,  allowing Tesla to rapidly improve current designs through operational learnings and to perform process testing  of R&D products.

      "9 9  Prioritization of cobalt, lithium and nickel  Given their unique significance to the success of EVs and energy storage, Tesla has a dedicated responsible  sourcing program for three priority minerals in the battery supply chain: cobalt, nickel and lithium. We prioritize  these raw materials for the following reasons:  1. Commercial importance: Cobalt, lithium and nickel are the key raw materials used in cathode production,  represent about a third of the total costs of a battery cell and play an essential function in improving vehicle  range and safety performance.  2. Potential environmental and social impact and scrutiny: Cobalt, lithium and nickel are also ‘minerals’ – in that  they are raw materials that are produced through different methods of mining around the world, often  concentrated in countries that face socio-economic and environmental challenges. As known global reserves  are depleted, these minerals are becoming increasingly scarce, and companies look to access resources in  more remote and challenging locations to meet global demand. Cobalt, lithium and nickel are also classified  as critical minerals by the United States, European Union and Canadian governments because they are  essential in enabling a transition away from fossil fuels to a low-carbon economy. As a result, the impact of  mining activity on the environment and local communities lends itself to greater environmental and social  scrutiny from civil society, policymakers and investors.  Mining has an important role to play in the transition to sustainable energy and we engage with suppliers to  ensure mining is done in a responsible way. This is one of the reasons Tesla joined the Initiative for Responsible  Mining Assurance (IRMA) and uses the IRMA Standard as well as other internationally recognized responsible  mining standards in our due diligence.  Battery Supply Chain #1 The Tesla Approach  \n",
      "\n",
      "1 0 0  The unique Tesla approach: Going directly to the source  The implementation of an OECD-aligned approach for cobalt, nickel and lithium is underpinned by the following  two pillars:  1. Direct sourcing from mining companies: While cobalt, nickel and lithium go through multiple processing  steps by different companies, some of the more important environmental and social risks in this supply chain  are present at mine sites. Direct sourcing from mining companies allows Tesla to engage directly in local  contexts instead of having to rely on multiple midstream companies that typically sit between EV makers  and mining. It also enables more transparent and traceable supply chains and better environmental and  social data. In 2021, Tesla procured >95% of lithium hydroxide, >50% of cobalt and >30% of nickel for nickel- containing (NCA and NCM) cells directly from nine mining and chemicals companies. All nine binding  contracts include environmental and social requirements. As Tesla’s battery supply chain continues to scale,  Tesla expects the proportion of directly sourced minerals to increase.  2. Direct local engagement: Building on direct supplier engagement, Tesla seeks to contribute to the  continuous improvement of conditions in communities affected by operations in Tesla’s supply chain,  informed by engagement with local experts, community organizations and civil society.

      "1 0 1  Our diversified cathode strategy  Tesla’s batteries today contain a variety of different cathode chemistries, including nickel-cobalt-aluminum  (NCA) and nickel-cobalt-manganese (NCM) for higher energy applications and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) for  lower energy applications. Tesla will continue to advance a diversified cathode strategy for LFP, nickel-rich and  manganese-rich cathodes to address various market segments for vehicle and energy storage products and  provide future flexibility based on raw materials availability and pricing. To put this into context, lithium only  accounts for roughly 1.5% of the full battery pack weight. Additionally, iron phosphate battery packs contain no  cobalt or nickel.   While the relative cathode compositions and our overall demand of various minerals and battery-grade  chemicals will continue to evolve, Tesla and the global battery supply chain will require significant quantities of  responsibly produced lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese, iron, phosphates and many other minerals for the  foreseeable future. While we recognize the critical role battery recycling will play in supplying a portion of these  materials to enable a closed loop supply chain, global cell production will continue to rely heavily on primary,  mined materials to meet the growing demand in the short to medium term. The availability and affordability of  these minerals and chemicals are key to advancing Tesla’s mission and accelerating the transition to sustainable  energy. We will continue to collaborate with our suppliers and upstream producers in providing visibility to  enable the scale up of key battery minerals.  For cells containing NCA and NCM cathodes, we continue to work toward batteries that contain higher levels of  nickel in order to improve vehicle range while lowering overall battery costs, without compromising overall cell  performance, such as battery safety and lifetime, that is currently enabled by cobalt. It is important to note that  we expect our absolute cobalt demand to increase over the coming years because our vehicle and cell  production growth rate is forecasted to outpace the overall rate of cobalt reduction on a per cell basis.

      "1 1 2  Tesla’s Supplier Audit program  In 2018, Tesla initiated its Supplier Audit program with the objective to extend our supplier performance  evaluation to key environmental and social impact metrics relevant to Tesla’s business. This program extension  was introduced at the time when Tesla was transitioning from a small automotive manufacturer to a company  gaining recognition as the leader in electrical vehicle production. We recognized that this growth came with an  increased ability to impact positive change on the practices of our suppliers, but also with an increased  responsibility to drive such change in line with our mission statement. During the program pilot phase, we  focused our efforts on suppliers that we deemed high risk based on their industry or the use of potentially  dangerous processes and/or chemicals in the manufacturing of our parts.  We chose to utilize the Responsible Business Alliance’s (RBA) Validated Assessment Program (VAP) as the  basis for our audits. The RBA’s VAP is an audit protocol globally recognized for its breadth of topics and  stringent requirements for supplier completion. It covers nearly 200 checkpoints across labor, health and safety,  environmental, ethical and management system topics. Audits are conducted by independent third parties that  are approved by the RBA, and all auditors must undergo training by the RBA on the audit standard and its  implementation ensuring a globally and industry-wide standardized approach.  In any case where any priority non-conformance (the most significant type) occurs, our audit procedures  require that suppliers undergo a closure audit. These closure audits – which are a follow up to the original audit  where the non-conformances were identified – allow suppliers to address all non-conformances in the earlier  audits. Additional audits, rather than an immediate suspension of the business relationship, are preferred to  improve working conditions and reduce the risk of continued deficiencies.  As of the end of 2021, we had a total of 152 supplier locations go through our supplier audit at least once,  representing 144 suppliers, or 10% of 2021 spend with our direct supply base. As part of these audits over 4,000  supplier employee interviews were conducted.  Responsible Sourcing Supplier Audit Program  \n",
      "\n",
      "1 1 3  Continuing to expand our audit program  In 2021, Tesla redefined its criteria for determining which of our suppliers are subject to the Supplier Audit  program. While in its initial stages the suppliers subject to the audit were mainly located in China, and the  updated criteria expanded the scope to include significantly more suppliers globally. When we started our audit  program, we had only just announced our plans for Gigafactory Shanghai. We now have six factories across  three different continents, and our production volume of vehicles has grown exponentially. As our global  footprint and manufacturing grew, so did our supply base. Therefore, the expansion of our audit program was  an important step to ensure that our supplier due diligence efforts continue to reflect the realities of our supply  chain and can properly identify and address potential risks within our supply base.  The criteria on which suppliers are selected to undergo the Supplier Audit is based on an expanded risk  assessment approach, looking at Tesla’s exposure to suppliers financially, as well as suppliers’ location. This  criteria determines which suppliers are obligated to undergo an audit, but additional suppliers can be  nominated by our commercial and supplier industrialization teams where they see value in doing so or the  potential to further mitigate risk. With the expanded audit program scope, we are targeting to cover over 50%  of our global spend with our direct supply base.  As part of our program expansion, we are building on our ability to influence supplier behavior in a positive  way. When a supplier is not meeting our expectations, they are obligated to implement corrective action plans  to remedy any deficiencies or non-conformances found during the audit process, regardless of the severity. In  cases of the highest priority non-conformances, suppliers are required to undergo closure audits to ensure that  their corrective action plans have been fully implemented. In cases of less severe non-conformances, suppliers  are still required to develop and implement corrective action plans as well as provide evidence to Tesla that  those plans have been fully implemented within our expected timelines.  Furthermore, we defined a separate category called Zero Tolerance Violations, which, for example, include any  violations related to the use of forced or child labor and inhumane treatment of workers. In cases where such  instances are discovered, our supply chain leadership will be informed, and a corrective action plan will be  developed immediately, together with the supplier. Tesla will transition away from the supplier relationship if the  supplier is unable or unwilling to correct the identified issues and improve their operations within a reasonable  time frame.

      "1 1 4  How we identify and prioritize risks in our supply chain  Our Supplier Audit program is an important part of our efforts to identify and address environmental and social  risks within our supply chain. These audits allow for a snapshot of a supplier facility’s programs and procedures,  but also sets a baseline for future evaluations. Additionally, Tesla utilizes other avenues to evaluate potential  risks in our supply chain such as those detailed below.  We engaged with several third-party service providers allowing us to continually monitor our supply chain for  emerging issues that may affect our suppliers. These include issues related to labor relations, human rights and  environmental degradation. This monitoring allows our Global Supply Managers to be notified as soon as  information about suppliers becomes public and act by engaging directly with the supplier to understand their  plans for correcting the identified risk.  Tesla follows the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct when identifying risks within  our supply chain. We require suppliers to cooperate with our efforts and assist in identifying and removing  practices within our supply chain that are contradictory to our policies. Our responsible sourcing policies  require suppliers to provide requested information regarding potential violations of our policies. Furthermore,  we continue to leverage our membership with the RBA to identify upcoming supply chain risks as well as  understand industry best practices to address them. We are actively involved with the RMI as well as specific  action groups within the organization. In addition, we have utilized many of the RBA tools, such as country risk  analysis to understand inherent risks in our supply chain and RBA-Online to collect information on corporate  and factory-specific supplier performance.

      "1 1 9  Summary – Environmental Impact  Topic Description Page(s)  Lifecycle Analysis of Tesla Vehicles  versus Average ICE  Regardless of where they are driven (U.S., Europe or China), a Model 3 and Model Y emit far fewer greenhouse  gas emissions per mile than a comparable ICE. Moving the grid toward more renewables and making our  operations and supply chain less GHG intensive will only make this dynamic more pronounced as time goes on.  56 – 67  GHG Emissions: Scope 1, 2, 3  We have disclosed our full Scope 1 and Scope 2 (location-based) emissions this year. We have also disclosed the  amount of CO2e emitted through the use of our vehicles (part of Scope 3). The global Supercharger network and  home charging in California were both 100% renewable in 2021, achieved through a combination of onsite  resources (for the Supercharger network only) and annual renewable matching.   68 – 69  NOx, Particulates and Other Pollutants New research shows that fossil fuels are alone responsible for more than 8 million premature deaths annually, or  almost one out of every five deaths globally, double previous estimates. Zero tailpipe emissions is a commonly  overlooked benefit of EVs.  70  Tesla Semi's Impact on Emissions Tesla Semi is poised to make a large impact: in the U.S., combination trucks make up just 1.1% of the vehicle fleet  but account for 17.9% of annual emissions. 71  Waste Generated per Vehicle  Manufactured  As we continue to build new, more efficient factories our ability to limit packaging and reduce waste increases.  Waste generated per vehicle in Shanghai production is 60% less than our manufacturing in the U.S. We continue  to push for innovative approaches to reducing waste as we expand our global operations.  72  Water Used per Vehicle Manufactured Water use per vehicle produced by Tesla was again below the industry average in 2021. Our new factories such as  Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg will set a new standard when it comes to low water use per vehicle. 73 - 74  Emissions Credits In 2021, Tesla delivered more than 2x as many EVs as our next closest competitor, helping drive $1.5bn in revenue  from selling regulatory credits. This money is being used to accelerate our production capacity deployment in  direct support of our mission.  75  \n",

      "1 2 0  Summary – Product Impact  Topic Description Page(s) Product Affordability  (Price Equivalency &  Total Cost of Ownership)  Model 3 is price competitively with ICE equivalents. But, when compared on a total cost of ownership basis, the  Model 3 is much closer to a Toyota Camry on all-in cost per mile than to an ICE equivalent such as a BMW 3  Series.  77 - 78  Product Usage & Usability Our data shows that Tesla vehicles are being driven more than average vehicles in the U.S., suggesting that they  are generally being used as a customer’s primary vehicle. The superior range of our vehicles and a robust global  Supercharger Network makes this possible.  79 - 80  Vehicle Safety At Tesla, safety features are not optional. Our full suite of safety features comes standard with every vehicle.  When we design vehicles, first and foremost, we want them to be safe. Our active safety features are powered by  eight cameras, a neural-net computer and learnings from our fleet of over two million cars.   81 – 84  Autopilot Safety  In 2021, we recorded 0.22 crashes for every million miles driven in which drivers were using Autopilot technology  (Autosteer and active safety features). For drivers who were not using Autopilot technology (no Autosteer and  active safety features), we recorded 0.77 crashes for every million miles driven. By comparison, NHTSA’s most  recent data shows that in the United States there are 1.81 automobile crashes for every million miles driven.  85  Data Driven Safety Tesla strived to go beyond industry standard testing. We leverage data from our fleet of over two million cars to  better understand accidents and build solutions around them. 86 - 87  Passive Safety & Tesla Safety Awards Since 2019, Tesla vehicles earned 5-star ratings from safety rating agencies across the U.S., Europe and Australia. 88 - 89  Fire Risk From 2012 to 2021, there has been approximately five Tesla vehicle fires for every billion miles traveled. By  comparison, data from the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and U.S. Department of Transportation  show that in the U.S. there are 53 vehicle fires for every billion miles travelled.  90  Solar + Storage Products Pairing energy storage with renewables is required to transition our grid to zero-emission sources. In 2021, in  order to meet demand that is well in excess of supply for energy storage products, Tesla began building a new  production facility capable of producing 40,000,000 kWh of energy storage per year.  91- 92  Resilience of the Grid Electric grid disturbances in the U.S. have increased dramatically over the last 15 years. Our solar and storage  products not only deliver cost savings and energy independence, but they also harden the grid from adverse  events in a cost-effective and environmentally friendly manner.  93  \n",

      "1 2 6  In 2021, we conducted a comprehensive materiality analysis to better understand the key ESG topics that were  most salient to our diverse group of stakeholders. To start, we identified over 40 issues in key areas that could  directly or indirectly impact our business. The topics ranged from economic, environmental, social and  governance issues. These issues were identified from four components: (1) a competitive landscape review, (2)  interviews with investors and other key external stakeholders, (3) industry reports and documented research,  such as the World Economic Forum’s 2021 Global Risks Report and (4) external ESG frameworks relevant to our  industry and regulatory requirements across global capital markets.  Tesla’s Sustainability Council refined the list of 40 key issues into a survey containing 25 questions in an effort  to help us prioritize these topics for operational management and disclosure in this year’s Impact Report. As  part of the assessment, we surveyed our key stakeholders, asking them to rate the identified economic and ESG  topics on a scale of 1-5, based on their perceived importance and impact to Tesla’s business. A total of 2,168  individuals from Tesla and approximately 40 external partners, including trade associations, universities,  suppliers, environmental consultants, nonprofits and local administrators, responded to the survey. 35% of  responses came from North America, 57% from China and 8% from Europe.

We endorse and base our definition of human rights on the United Nation's Universal Declaration for Human Rights (“UDHR”). The UDHR  focuses on dignity, respect, and equality, without discrimination, for all people. We are committed to upholding these rights and values throughout our value chain – including with respect to our  employees, customers, shareholders, suppliers, and the communities in which we operate.  Health and Safety  Suppliers are responsible for ensuring that their employees and  contractors are provided with a safe and healthy work  environment.  Respectful Workplace and Equal Opportunities  Tesla recognizes the value of different backgrounds and  perspectives in our workforce, and fully promotes equal  opportunity for all employees, both current and prospective.  Just as we do not discriminate on the basis of race, color,  religion, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression or  identity, national origin, disability, medical condition, military  and veteran status, marital status, pregnancy or any other  characteristic protected by law, regulation or ordinance, we  require our suppliers to similarly respect the people in their  workforces.  Environmental Protection  We expect our suppliers to share our goal of recognizing  environmental protection as a key principle of a sustainable  future.  Child Labor and Young Workers  Tesla strictly follows local and national laws restricting the  employment of underage workers. Regardless of local laws, no  workers at a facility or location that provides materials used in  Tesla products may be under the age of 15.  Relationship with Communities  Tesla is dedicated to being a responsible member of the  communities in which we live and operate. This goes beyond our  ability to create jobs and contribute to local value creation. We  expect suppliers to also take every effort to continuously  improve the positive aspects and reduce any negative impact of  their operations on the local community, including with respect  to environmental, social, and other quality of life factors.  Indigenous Rights  The mining industry on which Tesla relies to source many raw  materials that go into our products has historically had an  adverse impact on the rights of indigenous peoples and  communities in the areas in which they operate. For all raw  material extraction and processing used in Tesla products, we  expect our mining industry suppliers to engage with legitimate  representatives of indigenous communities and include the right  to free and informed consent in their operations.

      "1 3 4  Appendix  Metric / Disclosure / Topic Source(s) Methodology / Definition  Vehicle use-phase emissions, which represent 80-90% of total automotive emissions  (included in Scope 3 of ESG reporting), tend to be misreported due to the use of  unrealistic assumptions or not reported at all. OEM sustainability reports  Analysis of sustainability reports by auto OEMs shows unrealistic assumptions for both vehicle life and annual  mileage. For those that disclose their methodology we have found that vehicle life is often estimated to be as low  as 10 years and annual distance traveled by vehicles as low as 6,200 miles. This compares to an average life of 17  years in the U.S. (20 years in Europe) and 12,000 annual miles in the U.S. (and 7,450 in Europe). When taken  together, even before considering the impacts of using real-world MPG instead of NEDC, WLTP or EPA ratings, this  leads to a drastic under-reporting of Scope 3 emissions.  8.4 million metric tons of CO2e savings Tesla estimate  To estimate CO2e savings, we first measured the amount of miles driven by our vehicles and kWh of electricity  generated and stored by our solar panels and energy storage products at the state, province, and country level for  2021. We then applied an emissions savings factor (in gCO2e/mi for miles driven and gCO2e/kWh for electricity  generated), for each state, province, and country to estimate CO2e avoided. For miles driven, the emissions savings  factor is the net of estimated emissions from our vehicles and an ICE with a real-world fuel efficiency rating of ~24  mpg. The emissions savings factor is based on grid emissions intensity in each respective location and includes  upstream emissions from the production and transport of fuels.

Scope 2 emissions (location-based) are indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy.  Scope 3 emissions are all indirect emissions (not included in scope 2) that occur in the value chain of the reporting  company, including both upstream and downstream emissions. Emissions from the use of a company’s products are  included in Scope 3.  6,500 miles At the moment, the manufacturing process of a Model 3 results in slightly higher  GHG emissions than an equivalent combustion engine vehicle. However, based on  the global weighted average grid mix, a Model 3 has lower lifetime emissions than an  equivalent ICE after driving 6,500 miles. Tesla estimate  Estimate is based on the difference in CO2e emissions from the average of manufacturing phase of a Model 3 and  Model Y and an equivalent ICE which is then divided by the net CO2e savings per mile from a Model 3 and Model Y  versus an equivalent ICE. Net CO2e savings are based on delivery-weighted global grid mix.  70 tons: Lifetime CO2 emitted by an average combustion engine vehicle (model year  2021) sold in the U.S. through its use-phase, excluding CO2 emitted during the oil  refining phase.

      "1 3 6  Appendix  Metric / Disclosure / Topic Source(s) Methodology / Definition  Manufacturing Phase Emissions for Average Mid-Size Premium ICE Tesla, Sphera Solutions  In order to estimate the cradle-to-gate carbon footprints (GWP100) of select benchmark vehicles, a simplified  approach of multiplying their curb weights by a carbon intensity of ~5.5 kg CO2e/kg was chosen. This reference  value is based on a currently produced mid-size premium sedan that is comparable to the Model 3. The accuracy of  this estimate for the other ICE vehicles directly depends on how their material compositions compared to that of  the reference vehicle as well as on the existing variability of environmental impact profiles across different  geographies and suppliers.  As such, the specific carbon footprint (GWP100/kg) of the reference vehicle is only a proxy for the average  premium mid-size ICE vehicle. Based on past work on automotive LCAs (Rohde-Brandenburger & Koffler, 2019)  (Koffler C. 873 , 2013) (Koffler C. , 2010) (Koffler C. , Krinke, Schebek, & Buchgeister, 2008) (Koffler C. , 2007), the  uncertainty of these estimates is estimated to be less than ±20% for a cradle-to-gate system boundary, and  therefore less than ±5% once the use-phase is added.  The reference manufacturer’s Environmental Certificates are calculated using the same BOM import functionality of  the GaBi DfX software used for the Model 3 in the LCA authored by Sphera as well as GaBi 878 databases for all  background data.  Benchmark mid-size premium ICE vehicles include BMW 330i 2.0, Audi A4 2.0, Mercedes-Benz C300 2.0, Alfa  Romeo Giulia 2.0, Volvo S60 2.0, Cadillac ATS 2.0, Lexus IS 300 2.0 and Infiniti Q50 2.0. Benchmark cross-over SUV premium ICE vehicles include BMW X3, Audi Q5, Mercedes GLC, Jaguar F-Pace, AR  Stelvio, Volvo XC60, Cadillac XT5, Lexus NX and Porsche Macan.  Use-phase Emissions for Average Mid-Size Premium ICE Consumer Reports  Figured based on owner-reported fuel economy from Consumer Reports for the latest available model year (2018- 2020, depending on the make/model). 24.8 MPG is representative of the average of Alfa Romeo Giulia , Audi A4,  BMW 330i, Cadillac ATS, Infiniti Q50, Lexus IS 300, Mercedes-Benz C300, and Volvo S60. use-phase GWP100 of  ~400 gCO2e/mi includes gasoline production and distribution emissions from GaBi 2019 databases as well as  consideration of bio-fuel mix of gasoline in the U.S. (~12%).  Manufacturing Phase Emissions for Model 3 and Model Y Tesla  Figure inclusive of: raw and semi-finished material production including transportation, mechanical processing and  shaping, battery manufacturing, vehicle assembly and paint shop, all fuels and energy (natural gas, electricity, etc.),  other auxiliaries (lubricants, water, etc.) and end-of-life disposal.  Figure exclusive of: capital goods (e.g., machinery, buildings), infrastructure (e.g., roads, power transmission  systems), employee commute, external charging equipment and infrastructure, maintenance and service during use,  packaging, transport to recycler, disposal of manufacturing waste, inbound transportation from Tier 1 suppliers,  distribution to customers. Excluded activities are estimated to represent minor contributions to the cradle-to-gate  as well as the overall LCA results.  Where solar and storage are assumed to be a fuel source for the use-phase of the Model 3Y, emissions were  included in the manufacturing phase figure. The Model 3Y Rideshare Use (solar charged) scenario is allocated 100%  of these emissions on a per mile basis, while the Model 3Y Personal Use (solar charged) scenario is allocated 82% of  these emissions and 18% grid-charged emissions on a per mile basis (based on observed supercharging vs. other  split).  Use-phase Emissions for Model 3 and Model Y Tesla; U.S. Department of Energy; IEA; China  Electricity Council  Use-phase emissions for grid charging are based on Model 3 and Model Y delivery-weighted state, province and  country level grid mix based on grid carbon intensity data.

This is a conservative assumption based on recent new electricity  generation capacity trends and commitments made by states and countries to increase renewable mix on their  respective grids. Grid emission intensities include upstream emissions from the production and transport of fuels.

In order to be conservative, and normalize our figure based  on recent vehicle sales trends in each region, we divided total vehicle parc by average vehicles sales in the  respective regions for 2019 and 2020 (latest available data). This resulted in a scrappage age of 17 years and  200,000 miles in the U.S. and 20 years and 150,000 miles for Europe.

      "1 3 9  Overview  With respect to the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions metrics for the year ended  December 31, 2021 presented in table 2 below, which are also included in this Tesla Impact  Report 2021 as identified by the “*” symbol, management of Tesla, Inc. (Tesla) asserts that  the GHG emissions metrics are presented in accordance with the assessment criteria set  forth below.   Management is responsible for the selection of the criteria, which management believes  provide an objective basis for measuring and reporting on the GHG emissions metrics,  and for the completeness, accuracy, and validity of the GHG emissions metrics. Tesla’s  GHG emissions are rounded to the nearest thousand.   Organizational Boundary  Tesla uses the operational control approach to account for and report its Scope 1 and  Scope 2 GHG emissions. This includes sites engaged in manufacturing; sales, service, and  delivery; and other activities described below. Data for acquired sites are included once  the site has been operating for at least a year at the beginning of the reporting period.  Management Assertion  Scope 1 & 2 GHG Emissions  GHG Emissions Disclosure  1. Tesla considers the principles and guidance of the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the  World Business Council for Sustainable Development’s (WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol  Initiative’s A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Revised Edition, and GHG  Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, An amendment to the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard  (together the “GHG Protocol”) to guide the criteria to assess, calculate and report direct  and indirect GHG emissions.  2. GHG emissions quantification is subject to significant inherent measurement uncertainty  because of such things as GHG emissions factors that are used in mathematical models to  calculate GHG emissions, and the inability of these models, due to incomplete scientific  knowledge and other factors, to accurately measure under all circumstances the relationship  between various inputs and the resultant GHG emissions. Environmental and energy use  data used in GHG emissions calculations are subject to inherent limitations, given the nature  and the methods used for measuring such data. The selection by management of different  but acceptable measurement techniques could have resulted in materially different amounts  or metrics being reported.  Site Type Site Activities  Manufacturing Manufacture Tesla products, including vehicles, superchargers, solar tiles,   and energy storage products.

       " \"2  Foreword on Impact  Current ESG evaluation  methodologies are  fundamentally flawed. To  achieve acutely-needed  change, ESG needs to  evolve to measure real- world Impact.  What ESG measures today: Investment Risk  Current environmental, social and governance (ESG)  reporting does not measure the scope of positive impact  on the world. Instead, it focuses on measuring the dollar  value of risk / return.  Individual investors – who entrust their money to ESG  funds of large investment institutions – are perhaps  unaware that their money can be used to buy shares of  companies that make climate change worse, not better.  An obvious example of this is measuring the impact of the  automotive industry. One might think that the more electric  vehicles an automaker sells, as a percentage of total  volumes, the better its ESG score. However, this is not the  case. As long as a company continues to slightly decrease  emissions of its manufacturing operations while churning  out gas-guzzlers, its ESG ratings are likely to go up.  Vehicle use-phase emissions, which represent 80-90% of  total automotive emissions (included in Scope 3 of ESG  reporting), tend to be misreported due to the use of  unrealistic assumptions or not reported at all.  It’s easy to see why some oil & gas companies rank higher  than Tesla on “Environmental Impact.”  “The most striking feature of the [ESG rating] system is  how rarely a company’s record on climate change seems to  get in the way of its climb up the ESG ladder—or even to  factor at all.”  ESG Mirage: Bloomberg Businessweek  What ESG needs to become: Company Impact  We need to create a system that measures and scrutinizes  actual positive impact on our planet, so unsuspecting  individual investors can choose to support companies that  can make and prioritize positive change.  On the product front, companies should be required to use  real-world data wherever remotely feasible and make it  clear when estimates are provided instead of real-world  figures. An example of this is vehicle “use-phase”  emissions, accounting for the vast majority of lifecycle  emissions. Automakers' estimates on lifetime vehicle  mileage and lifetime fuel consumption vary dramatically  and almost never reflect real-world data. Automakers often  have access to this data, but they don’t disclose it.  When it comes to a company’s employees, it is essential  that they’re treated well, with a system in place to prevent  discrimination of any kind, that they have a safe  workplace and that they are rewarded appropriately, with  significant upside if their employer does well.  Many ESG ratings evaluate: “Does this ESG issue impact the  profitability of the company?” We need a system that  evaluates: “Does the growth of this company have a  positive impact on the world?”  This evolution of ESG needs to be championed by  institutional investors, rating agencies, public companies  and the general public. As the world needs to strive for a  substantial positive impact, we won’t be referring to ESG in  this report. Instead, we’ll talk about Impact.  https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2021-what-is-esg-investing-msci-ratings-focus-on-corporate-bottom-line/  \\n3  In 2021, the global fleet of Tesla vehicles, energy storage and solar panels  enabled our customers to avoid emitting 8.4 million metric tons of CO2e  The 6.8 million metric tons of vehicle CO2e savings estimate is based on the net CO2e savings during the use-phase of a Tesla vehicle compared to an ICE vehicle with a real-world fuel economy of  ~24 mpg (of which 0.9 million metric tons was avoided through annual renewables matching for the global Supercharger network and home charging in California). The 1.6 million metric tons of  solar + storage CO2e savings estimate is based on CO2e avoided through generation of zero-emission electricity from Tesla solar panels, including energy stored and later dispatched from our  energy storage products. Geographic distribution of our deliveries (both vehicle and solar), grid mix at the country, state and province level and upstream emissions are reflected in these figures.  \",\n",

       " '7  Our Goals Tesla’s purpose is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.  We strive to be the best on every metric relevant to our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to  sustainable energy. To maximize our impact, we plan to continue increasing our production volumes and the  accessibility of our products. In more concrete terms, this means that by 2030 we are aiming to sell 20 million  electric vehicles per year (compared to 0.94 million in 2021) and deploy 1,500 GWh of energy storage per year  (compared to 4 GWh in 2021).  If we were to achieve such a vehicle delivery milestone through a consistent growth rate, the total Tesla vehicle  fleet would surpass tens of millions of vehicles by 2030, and each of those vehicles could save tons of CO2e  emissions every year of usage.  Furthermore, each product we make must be continuously improved at each step of its lifecycle: from  manufacturing to consumer use to recycling.  We must also improve every metric, including the energy and water used to make our products, how safe our  customers and employees are and the affordability and accessibility of our products. Each of these themes will  be covered in this year’s Impact Report.  ',\n",
       " \"8  Making an Impact Mission and the Tesla Ecosystem  Sustainability drives us. And not just our products — it drives our values and mission as a company. It's at the  core of everything we do and is what motivates us in our work. It also matters greatly to our customers,  employees and shareholders. Our products and services are focused on transportation, energy production and  storage — each of which have traditionally been some of the biggest polluters both in the U.S. and globally.  To achieve a zero-emissions future, we continue to implement programs and initiatives at our global  manufacturing facilities and in our local communities.

Source: World Resources Institute  \",\n",
       " '9  Making an Impact Mission and the Tesla Ecosystem  Addressing climate change through an entire ecosystem  Climate change is reaching alarming levels globally due in large part to emissions from burning fossil fuels for  transportation and electricity generation. The world cannot reduce GHG emissions without addressing both  energy generation and consumption. And the world cannot address its energy habits without first directly  reducing emissions in the transportation and energy sectors.  We are designing and manufacturing a complete energy and transportation ecosystem. We both develop the  technology behind this ecosystem and focus on the affordability of the products that comprise it. We seek to  achieve this through our R&D and software development efforts as well as through our continuous drive to  develop advanced manufacturing capabilities.   ',\n",
       " '1 0  Corporate  Governance  ',\n",
       " \"1 1  Corporate Governance Introduction  Management involvement  At Tesla, sustainability is everyone's job regardless of their position, geographic location or title. Our  Sustainability Council, made up of leaders from across Tesla, collects data and prepares the analysis and  content of this report. The Sustainability Council also presents this information to Tesla’s Board of Directors for  review.  Board of Directors oversight  The Board of Directors serves as a prudent fiduciary for shareholders and oversees the management of Tesla’s  business — including reviewing the effectiveness of Tesla’s Impact priorities, initiatives and programs and this  report. With those responsibilities in mind, the Board sets high standards for Tesla and its employees, officers  and directors; and we periodically add new, highly qualified independent directors to the Board, such as Larry  Ellison and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson in 2018 and Hiromichi Mizuno in 2020. Implicit in this approach is the  importance of sound corporate governance.  \",\n",
       " '1 2  Corporate Governance  Introduction  Sound corporate governance is critical to our mission. We are committed to establishing an operating  framework that exercises appropriate oversight of responsibilities at all levels throughout the company and  manages its affairs consistent with high principles of business ethics.  Tesla aspires to be a “do the right thing” company. Our Code of Business Ethics sets out basic principles that  should help anyone working at or for Tesla avoid even the appearance of improper behavior. Tesla’s Code of  Business Ethics and our Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on Tesla’s website.  In addition, we believe in regular and transparent communication with employees. We encourage Tesla  employees to share their feedback openly (and anonymously, if they prefer), and provide easy methods to do  so. We also regularly conduct employee surveys to identify strengths and opportunities for improvement. We  have a robust action planning process to ensure we proactively address the concerns or feedback.  We also have a whistleblower hotline through which employees can report concerns at any time. Tesla keeps  information reported by employees in confidence, whether through the hotline or another channel. Our policies  prohibit retaliatory actions against employees for raising concerns or making complaints. We are committed to  maintaining an open and transparent culture where it is safe and acceptable for all employees to raise concerns  about policy violations by their manager or colleagues or about the workplace overall.  http://ir.tesla.com/corporate-governance/highlights  \\n1 3  Corporate Governance Our Approach  Our unique business requires a unique approach to corporate governance. And our mission requires a long-term  focus that we believe will ultimately maximize value to our employees and our stockholders. Our corporate  governance structure has facilitated several key decisions which might have appeared counter-intuitive to some,  but which have set up the Tesla to achieve long-term success. Some examples include our decisions to:  ',\n",
       " 'Manufacture all-electric vehicles (EVs) from the ground up rather than being a mere supplier of EV  components  ',\n",
       " 'Establish an international network of our own stores, service centers and Supercharger stations despite  regulatory hurdles and the significant capital outlay required to do so  ',\n",
       " 'Build Gigafactory 1, the largest lithium-ion battery factory in the world, so that we can scale most effectively  ',\n",
       " 'Expand into energy generation and storage through the acquisition of SolarCity Corporation in 2016 to  create a vertically integrated sustainable energy company and empower individual consumers to be their  own utility  ',\n",
       " 'Deploy FSD city streets beta software to our fleet to develop complete Full Self-Driving capability in the  future  ',\n",
       " 'Compensate our CEO only if other shareholders realize tremendous value  These and other similar decisions were made due to our corporate governance structure and, ultimately,  decisions like these are what differentiate Tesla from other companies and are a significant reason why the  annualized stockholder return since our 2010 IPO until December 31, 2021 equaled 65%. At the same time, the  Board continuously evaluates our corporate governance structure, practices and policies, and weighs  stakeholder feedback including proposals we have historically received at our annual meetings. For example, at  our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders, the Board proposed and recommended that stockholders adopt an  amendment to our certificate of incorporation to reduce the term of our directors to two years. However, our  stockholders did not approve that proposal.  The Board is directly and regularly engaged with senior management and the Sustainability Council and  participates in robust shareholder outreach and feedback. In addition, our directors have significant experience  as either top-level executives at public companies, as successful investors or as entrepreneurs who founded  successful organizations.  ',\n",
       " '1 4  Committees of the Board  The Board has four standing committees — the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the  Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Disclosure Controls Committee — which are each  further described in the following pages. Each member of these committees qualifies as an independent  director under the listing standards of NASDAQ. In addition, as part of our governance review and succession  planning, the Board (led by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee) evaluates our leadership  structure to ensure that it remains the optimal structure for Tesla, reviews the composition, size and  performance of the Board and its committees, evaluates individual directors and identifies and evaluates  candidates for election or re-election to the Board. Committee charters were updated in 2021 to reflect the  growing risks and opportunities around ESG.  Board role in risk oversight  The Board is responsible for overseeing the major risks facing Tesla, while management is responsible for  assessing and mitigating Tesla’s risks on a day-to-day basis. In addition, the Board has delegated oversight of  certain categories of risk to its independent committees, which then report to the Board, as appropriate, on  matters that involve the specific areas of risk that each committee oversees.

Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for, among other things, reviewing and  making recommendations to the Board on matters concerning corporate governance, Board composition, the  identification, evaluation and nomination of director candidates and composition of Board committees and  conflicts of interest. In addition, this Committee oversees Tesla’s corporate governance practices and reviews  annually the principles of corporate governance approved by the Board, including the Company’s Code of  Business Ethics and Corporate Governance Guidelines, to ensure that they remain relevant and are being  complied with and monitored by management, recommending changes to the Board as necessary.

       " '1 6  Our compensation philosophy reflects our long-term mission and our startup origins. We emphasize structuring  compensation to reward our named executive officers based on performance, and equity awards weigh heavily  in our named executive officers’ total compensation, including awards that vest upon the achievement of clear  and measurable milestones. Since these awards increase in value as our stock price increases (and in the case of  stock option awards, have no value unless our stock price increases following their grant), our named executive  officers’ incentives are closely aligned with the long-term interests of our stockholders.  Tesla has no cash bonus program for any of our named executive officers and generally does not provide any  perquisites or tax reimbursements to our named executive officers that are not available to other employees. No  named executive officer has any severance or change of control arrangement, except as reflected in Elon Musk’s  performance-based 2018 CEO Performance Award.  A change in control modifies the vesting requirements of  the 2018 CEO Performance Award such that vesting of the Award’s tranches would be measured based on  Tesla’s market capitalization at the time of the change of the control, without regard to the operational  milestones of the Award. Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, historically earned a base salary that reflected  the applicable minimum wage requirements under California law, and he was subject to income taxes based on  such base salary. However, he has never accepted his salary. Commencing in May 2019 at Mr. Musk’s request, we  eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of this base salary. Consequently, 100% of Mr. Musk’s  compensation is at-risk.  Similarly, the compensation program for Tesla’s non-employee directors is designed to be consistent with our  compensation philosophy for our employees, with an emphasis on equity-based compensation over cash in  order to align the value of their compensation with the market value of our stock, and consequently, with the  long-term interests of our stockholders. Moreover, while we offer to our general employee population restricted  stock units that will retain some value even if the market value of our stock decreases, the equity-based  compensation to our directors has been exclusively in the form of stock options, which have zero initial value  and accumulate value, if at all, only to the extent that our stock price increases following their grant, through  the applicable vesting dates and until such stock options are ultimately exercised and the underlying shares are  sold. The remaining portion of our directors’ compensation has been comprised of cash retainer payments that  are relatively modest compared to peer companies and that may be waived at the election of each  director. Further, in June 2021, the Board adopted a resolution that all existing directors forego any automatic  grants of annual stock option awards under our director compensation policy until July 2022 unless the Board  determines otherwise.

We work closely with the security research community to  benefit from their collective expertise and diversity of thought.  Continuous product improvement  Tesla pioneered the concept of vehicles that improve and become more capable over time by ensuring that  every Tesla vehicle made since 2012 can accept over-the-air (OTA) software updates. These updates have  introduced new features and functionality that have made our vehicles smarter, safer and more enjoyable to  drive.

Tesla is committed  to ensuring that our suppliers do not use slave or child labor or engage in human trafficking. Modern slavery,  child labor and human trafficking are crimes under the laws of countries throughout the world, but  unfortunately continue to exist all over the globe. Our commitment on this front is summarized in our Supplier  Code of Conduct as well as in our Human Rights Policy and Responsible Materials Policy, and we continue to  work to ensure that our suppliers uphold the principles in these statements. We look to the Organization for  Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Due Diligence Guidelines to inform our process and use  feedback from our internal and external stakeholders to find ways to continually improve it.  Through our commitment to enforce our Supplier Code of Conduct, Human Rights Policy and Responsible  Materials Policy, continuous training and the supplier audit and due diligence efforts, Tesla believes that there is  low risk of, and have found no evidence to date of Tesla causing, contributing to or being linked to modern  slavery, child labor or human trafficking in our supply chain.

To continue innovating and changing the world for the  better, we must ensure we have a talented and engaged workforce with ample opportunity to contribute to our  mission and grow professionally.  Meaningful work: Working for Tesla is not just any job. The products we build are necessary for transitioning to  a sustainable future.  Respectful, safe, inclusive and equitable workplace: Tesla is a majority-minority company. We strive to be a  workplace where people love to come to work every day. While challenges will arise, Tesla has a zero-tolerance  policy for harassment of any kind, and we will continue to address them head on as we keep growing.  We hire a lot: We created nearly 100,000 direct new jobs in a decade. While many manufacturers are trimming  their operations, we are growing as quickly as is feasible.  Pay well: We want to make sure that we pay competitive wages, regardless of the region.  Significant upside potential: Every single employee of our company can receive their grants in stocks or  options. If our company does well, every employee can benefit materially from Tesla’s success.  Outstanding benefits: We want our benefits to be an outlier in the manufacturing industry. Among other  benefits, we provide medical, dental and vision plans with no paycheck deductions, 401k matching, life  insurance, parental leave and family building benefits.  Build the future: Who wouldn’t want to work for a company with a mission of building a future we all want?  Tesla’s mission is not only about making a product that people love, but also about making a real, sustained  impact on transitioning the world to sustainable energy. In 2021, we received 3,000,000 job applications from  those wanting to be a part of this mission.  People and Culture Introduction  ',\n",

While many companies in the automotive industry have been trimming the number  of employees and launching early retirement programs, we plan to grow our employee base for years to come.  As we are aiming to produce over 20x more cars by 2030 than we did in 2021, we will need to continue to build  new factories and hire for those new locations. Gigafactories in Texas and Berlin will recruit extensively starting  this year, which means that our job creation will continue to expand for quite some time.   ',\n",

Many successful companies with great engineering can become bureaucratic over time. We don’t want to go  that route. At Tesla, great engineering ideas worth implementing can come from interns, analysts or executives.  We strive to minimize red tape so our engineers can be creative and solve engineering problems that have  never been solved.  Ultimately, the long-term success of any company comes down to the pace of innovation. It doesn’t matter how  far ahead or far behind our technology is, what matters is the pace at which we’re evolving, implementing new  ideas and engineering solutions.

We  have long stated publicly that candidates do not need to have a college degree to work at Tesla. This represents  an enormous opportunity for high school graduates from underserved communities to join us in our mission and  grow their careers.  Manufacturing Development Program  This is a two-year program where recent high school graduates in the U.S. start a career at Tesla as a production  associate while continuing their education in automation and robotics at a local community college. Since its  launch in 2017, we've hired 168 graduates into this program, with active programs at Gigafactory Nevada,  Gigafactory New York and our Fremont Factory. We also launched our first Manufacturing Development  Program class with Del Valle High School to support Gigafactory Texas in fall 2021.   Tool & Die Apprenticeship   In partnership with local community colleges, Tesla offers a federal and state certified Tool & Die Apprenticeship  program in the U.S. at the Fremont Factory, Gigafactory Nevada and Tesla Grand Rapids. These apprenticeships  blend on-the-job training by qualified mentors with classroom learning, providing a holistic approach to  learning a trade in high demand. Apprentices learn welding, machining, blueprint reading and other critical  skills. Similar programs run in Europe, including at the Gigafactory Berlin where we collaborate with local  vocational schools and train students via facilitated workshops, self-led modules and on-the-job exercises for a  variety of roles.

       " '2 7  Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day & National Manufacturing Day  To promote gender diversity in STEM, since 2018, Tesla has encouraged girls to see engineering as a means to pursue their goals by participating in Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day. This year, over 1,200 middle school  students from 140 schools across California, Nevada, Texas and New York joined the virtual event which  showcased a variety of engineering career pathways and inspiring female Tesla engineers through virtual tours,  engaging videos and hands-on STEM activities. Similar initiatives take place in Europe, like Girls’ Day, which is  dedicated to girls who want to explore future career paths in the industry. Our aim is to encourage and inspire  them via factory tour visits and conversations with our female employees and leaders.  Internship program  Our internship program continues to be our driving force in attracting diverse entry level professional talent. In  our effort to expand access to our program, we attended more than 75 diversity hiring events targeting women  and students of Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions, and launched new  community Internship Initiatives with Say Yes Buffalo, Breakthrough Austin, TRiO Scholars in Nevada and  College Track in the Bay Area to increase diversity in our program.   K-12 education in Nevada  As part of our agreement to build Gigafactory Nevada, we committed to invest $37.5M into K-12 education  beginning in 2018. This investment is in partnership with the Department of Education and the Education Gift  Fund, with a focus on initiatives that support the acceleration of robotics, STEAM and sustainability  programming. To date, $22.5M has been invested across 30 organizations and an additional $17M planned in  2022-2023.   Conference spotlight: Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers  The SHPE National Convention serves as the country’s largest annual gathering of Hispanic STEM students and  professionals. We met over 3,000 students from various disciplines and had the opportunity to build some  great relationships along the way with various SHPE chapter leaders in the country. Tesla’s DEI team also  participated in the SHPETina series during the conference, which is a program that accelerates and affirms  Latina representation at all levels of STEM corporate and academic leadership.

In 2021, Tesla’s average national wage for manufacturing jobs in  the U.S. was $21.60/hour plus benefits (which, among others listed on the next page, includes an option for $0  cost paycheck deductions) and equity, which is a 2.2% increase compared to 2020. According to the Bureau of  Labor Statistics, the mean hourly wage for Production Associates / Assemblers is $18.17 and the median is  $17.59. Tesla continuously reviews salary and wages against benchmarks and adjusts to ensure wages are  competitive. Evaluations for promotions also take place annually.  The impact of stock-based compensation can be material for employees  Our employees have benefited enormously from value appreciation of our stock seen through the years. While  share prices will remain volatile and past performance is not indicative of future results, stock-based  compensation brings shared ownership to the workforce, and our employees are encouraged to make a positive  change for the benefit of all. Culturally, shared ownership of the company is one of the most essential attributes  of working at Tesla.   For example, assume that an employee received a grant of 320 Tesla shares in 2018 that vested 20 shares  quarterly over 16 quarters (4 years). Based on the stock price at the time of the grant, the quarterly vest of 20  Tesla shares would equate to $1,331-worth of sellable shares at the end of 2018. However, the same vest two  years later would equate to $14,113-worth of sellable shares per quarter based on the increase in the price per  share of Tesla stock over that period. Employees are also eligible to buy additional stock at a discount through  the Employee Stock Purchase Program.

Our early years of Model 3 production and global expansion were some of  the most difficult in our history and our employee satisfaction ratings (Glassdoor) reflected that.  Our company is in a different phase now. Model 3 has become the best-selling premium sedan globally and  profitability (operating margin) rose to the highest in the industry. This has fueled our ability to expand  dramatically and provide career opportunities for many strong performers. Compensation, linked to the  performance of the company, also improved substantially in recent years.   There’s still a lot of work to be done, predominantly when it comes to work-life balance. Our goals have always  been, and still are, bold. Expectations are understandably high as a result. We recently introduced unlimited  vacation for salaried employees and added more family benefits. Both Glassdoor rankings as well as our internal  data show that our employees are becoming happier as a result of our growing success as well as our expanded  employee benefit programs.

As nearly 70% of our leadership is promoted from within Tesla, our employees are surrounded by examples of  successful progression. Our global headcount increased by over 40% in 2021.

       " \"3 5  Integrating Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) principles and practices into the DNA of our company  In 2020, we instituted quarterly diversity data reviews across different divisions. These ensure that we identify  trends across functions instead of simply looking at our workforce at the company-wide level. Executives review  organizational demographics and work with their DEI, HR and Recruiting partners to create an action plan to  attract, develop and retain talent.  That same year, we also took steps to incorporate DEI principles into talent management. The fundamental pillar  in this strategy is consistent and fair performance reviews — a reliable review process leads to more equitable  access to internal opportunities. Since 2020, we have routinely delivered performance reviews to over 99% of all  employees globally. The program has led to improvements in our internal mobility program and employees'  access to career opportunities within Tesla.  We expanded our leadership development team with a focus on providing DEI offerings to all our U.S.  employees. Now all employees are introduced to our DEI principles on their first day as part of orientation and  can continue their DEI learning journey throughout their time at Tesla. From our allyship resources, to DEI Life  Hacks on our DEI Knowledge Center, to virtual instructor led courses on unconscious bias, inclusive interviewing  and inclusive leadership, our employees have access to information no matter where they are.

       " '4 1  Connecting communities to opportunities with Tesla  During the global pandemic, we focused a great deal on expanding our community engagement and ensuring  our employees stayed connected. Specifically, we expanded our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) and  ensured our programming was accessible in a remote work environment. We welcomed Asian Pacific Islanders  at Tesla to our ERG family. While this was a time of uncertainty and change, through our ERGs, we ensured our  employees felt more heard and connected than ever before as they pivoted to virtual events to promote  inclusion across different locations, physical boundaries and time zones.  At Tesla, we strive to have a diverse supply chain and create the maximum practical opportunities to provide  goods and services as a part of the corporate procurement process. We formalized collaboration between the  DEI, Supply Chain and Government Affairs teams to ensure local minority, women, LGBTQ+, disabled and  veteran owned businesses are connected to opportunities with Tesla. We recognize that supplier diversity  creates a competitive advantage for the company and has a positive impact on the global community. As the  supplier diversity program develops, we will implement plans that encourage increased usage of diverse  suppliers throughout our organization, partner with internal and external stakeholders to identify opportunities  for diverse suppliers and work with external partners to encourage capacity building for diverse suppliers.

With over 100,000  employees as of March 2022, challenges arise, and we address them head on.  In 2021, we re-doubled our efforts to educate employees and managers that any form of discrimination must be  reported. While our goal is always prevention, reported complaints of discrimination and harassment are  promptly investigated and if substantiated, subject to discipline up to and including termination. New  employees receive anti-harassment and discrimination training during orientation. A new employee guidebook  was also rolled out which instructs employees to report all forms of misconduct without concern.   As the company continues to hire tens of thousands of workers per year, educating our workforce is a top  priority and an ongoing process.  ',\n",
       " \"4 3  People and Culture Respectful Workplace  How we're meeting our commitments to equal opportunity employment and a diverse and inclusive  environment  We believe it’s essential to provide all employees with a respectful and safe working environment where all  employees can achieve their potential. As a result, we do not tolerate discrimination, harassment or any  mistreatment of employees in the workplace or work-related situations. Below are some of the actions we are  taking to ensure the proper treatment of all employees.  Training: Code of Business Ethics and harassment & discrimination training for front-line leaders, HR partners  and other employees to understand how to create and promote a respectful workplace, assess situations sooner  and escalate appropriately.  Internal Tracking System Enhancement: An enhancement to our internal tracking system now allows HR to  document all employee concerns that are raised to ensure there is follow through and resolution for tracking  purposes. Additionally, handling concerns at the initial stage helps prevent them from becoming bigger issues.  The case management system also allows the appropriate teams to review data to trend and issue spot, which  then can lead to proactive solutions before concerns arise.  Internal Mobility: A program that advocates for and provides equal access to employee advancement  opportunities and retention with eligibility for opportunities based on standardized performance reviews.  Opportunities are advertised on an internal site with career resources in addition to a monthly newsletter. We  also offer 1-on-1 support and personal consultations to understand the career aspirations of internal applicants.  Third-party managed integrity line  We encourage employees to raise concerns internally or externally. An employee can raise concerns or  complaints to any member of management, Human Resources or Employee Relations (ER). If they prefer to  report another way, the Integrity Line is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The Integrity Line allows  employees to report concerns anonymously and without fear of retaliation.  If any employee raises a good faith concern, HR, together with ER, will ensure that employee concerns are  investigated promptly and impartially in a manner appropriate to the circumstances. The Employee Relations  team engages in feedback loops with leaders and HR to provide guidance on any appropriate follow-up actions,  which range from additional communication and training to corrective action and discipline up to termination of  employment.  \",\n",
       " '4 4  Why engagement matters for retention  Employee engagement drives productivity, satisfaction and loyalty and plays a critical role in employee  retention. Tesla’s engagement initiatives strive to make employees feel informed, valued and respected, while  company-wide open-door policies with leaders empower employees to make their ideas heard. When we feel  connected to the Tesla community and mission, we unlock our full potential as a workforce.  What we are doing to keep employees engaged  To promote engagement, we lead initiatives driven by employee feedback. Throughout the year, we use  roundtables, engagement surveys and other feedback forms to gather data and better understand the  employee experience.  Our team uses this data to inform our communication strategies. In addition to a monthly newsletter emailed to  all U.S. employees and physically posted at manufacturing sites, we launched a new company-wide internal  news platform with weekly updates on company news, employee recognition and events.  We highlight business, people and safety updates via both email and an expansive network of video screens. In  2021, we also produced two live and virtual companywide all-hands.  These channels pair with the revitalization of daily Start-Up meetings for assembly workers to streamline  communications across the Fremont Factory. HR members also staff on-site Answer Bar kiosks to address  employee questions and concerns at many of our office locations.  Engagement requires making resources more accessible. This translates to regular on-site tabling and fairs for  benefits, as well as making information available digitally. We manage internal resource websites for product  knowledge, employee perks, recognition, employee volunteering, health and fitness and offer virtual info  sessions with subject matter experts.

       " '4 5  People and Culture Disaster Relief  Supporting Ukraine  We are committed to providing disaster relief through product donations. Our relief efforts to the conflict in  Ukraine have provided people with the ability to communicate and power communities.   In March 2022, Tesla employees in Europe volunteered to design, prototype and deploy the first 50 kits  containing Powerwalls, Gateways and solar inverters to support continued energy access in Ukraine. When  paired with one of the 250 solar panels dispatched by volunteers at Gigafactory Berlin, these mini power plants  can assist Ukrainian communications and essential services indefinitely by using solar to recharge Powerwalls.  Along with Starlink Terminals used for satellite internet access (made by SpaceX), the kits were shipped to the  Ukranian border in Poland, at which point they were transferred onto military trucks. The kit can begin providing  power almost instantly, without any tools or technical experience required. With the Powerwall kit alone, a user  can power Starlink for five days. With solar panels installed and operational, the kits can provide indefinite  power for Starlink Terminal, plus a small appliance or laptop.  Surrounding European countries  In addition to product donations, Tesla has opened free Supercharging at all stations in Poland, Slovakia and  Hungary to support those impacted by the recent events. Within hours of implementation, Tesla emailed local  owners announcing that several Supercharger stations near Ukraine could be used by Tesla and non-Tesla  electric vehicles, free-of-charge.  ',\n",
       " '4 6  People and Culture Disaster Relief  Hurricane Ida  In the aftermath of Hurricane Ida, Tesla worked with NGO partners such as the Footprint Project, and certified  installers in the New Orleans Area (Solar Alternatives, Posigen) to deploy Powerwall and solar panel disaster  relief systems. We deployed 14 systems to over 10 sites, including food distribution centers, churches, a  warehouse, a fire station, a shelter and command center for NGOs. Most systems stayed in place for six weeks  while the grid was down; in cases where the building was too damaged to return power after the grid was back  up the systems remained in place for substantially longer. Our partners estimate that these systems provided  power to over 1,000 people including recovery workers, food distribution volunteers and first responders.  Kentucky Storms  After the Kentucky winter storms, we deployed two systems at a research and education center in Princeton,  Kentucky in partnership with the Footprint Project. These systems helped power communications trailers and  mobile offices for over 50 recovery workers. They are still deployed while the center is being rebuilt and we are  exploring ways to turn the trailers and mobile offices into a training center for future recovery workers.  Texas Winter Storm  In February 2021, Texas experienced a weather event that caused the widespread loss of power for several days  affecting thousands of residents. Tesla provided a disaster relief system to Pathways Youth & Family Services,  Inc., a non-profit social service organization providing foster care, adoption and behavioral health services to  communities across Texas. The system consisted of four mobile Powerwall units (for a total of ~100kWh of  batteries and 40kW of power). With this system, Pathways was able to restore heat and power to its facilities,  enabling it to resume housing and other social services to children.  ',\n",
       " '47  In 2021, our focus remained on protecting people, the planet, our property and products. We were able to  improve our performance in Environmental, Health, Safety and Security (EHS&S) by turning to the experts in  Tesla – our own employees. We evolved the way we define safety, developed internal tools to drive execution,  actively sought worker improvement suggestions and established a more structured EHS&S audit program to  identify safeguards and drive operational excellence throughout all areas of the business.  Our EHS&S strategy remains focused on three pillars:  1. Do the Basics Right | 2. Engage and Empower Our Stakeholders | 3. Reduce Risk  Changing how we define safety and build capacity: Human and Organizational Performance (HOP) and  Operational Learning  As we grew and evolved as an EHS&S organization, so did our view of safety. The Human and Organizational  Performance (HOP) and Operational Learning group was developed in 2021 to integrate our new view of safety  into the organization.  In an ever-changing and dynamic work environment, we recognized the need to focus on creating the ability to  fail safely. Creating the ability to fail safely is comprised of three components:  1. Engaged workers: workers who are connected to and care about the work they do. When workers are  engaged, they are more likely to identify and communicate vulnerabilities in the system.  2. Agility: the ability to continuously navigate and adapt in an ever-changing, complex and dynamic work  environment.  3. Safeguards: the hardware, software and human actions that directly prevent an event or mitigate a bad  outcome.  Instead of defining safety as the absence of accidents, we define safety as the presence of capacity. Capacity  can be defined as the ability to mitigate outcomes and reduce system brittleness.  People and Culture Safety  ',\n",
       " '4 8  Develop tools to drive execution of EHS&S — MyEHS  In order to build capacity and allow our workers to fail safely, we needed a more dynamic approach to how we  collect and manage data that allows us to make decisions that reduce risk. In response to that need, we  developed an internal EHS&S tool named MyEHS to help drive execution and improve outcomes by allowing the  intake and visualization of data globally. We designed and deployed 11 modules in 2021, allowing us to better  manage our EHS&S information, identify emerging risks and take action to implement improvements suggested  by our employees.  Foremost in this effort was our improvement suggestion module — Take Charge. Combined with Action Tracker,  this module allows workers to submit improvement suggestions in various categories, including environment,  health, safety, security, people and accuracy, while connecting with their supervisors and other work groups to  identify and implement solutions to improve the presence of safeguards.  Take Charge case study — Sherry Ihrig  Leading the way with Take Charge submissions is Sherry Ihrig, with over 1,800 improvement suggestions to  safety, processes, cost-savings and more since the program’s start in early 2021.  “Tesla promotes the concept that ‘safety is a shared responsibility,’ and the Take Charge program truly  empowers me to take a more active role in sharing that responsibility,” Ihrig said.  “The Take Charge program encourages associates to increase their awareness of the work environment,” Ihrig said. “When these and other potential safety hazards are noticed and resolved, it allows associates to improve  their overall work performance.”  While Ihrig has enjoyed many parts of her experience at Tesla, from teaming up with “hardworking, outgoing  individuals” to learning how to operate a fire extinguisher in emergency response training, the most exciting  part has been the Take Charge program.  Engaged employees like Sherry help Tesla build capacity to ensure safeguards are in place and functioning, so  that when we fail, we fail safely.

We examine  our safety data to identify emerging risks, comparable events for innovative solutions and to better understand  how we can systematically improve across our highest risk areas to help keep our people, the planet, our  products and property safe.  We have turned our attention away from traditional OSHA metrics, but we continue to maintain information on  them for regulatory purposes. We use these metrics, amongst many others, to examine how how we can see the  results of our commitment to safety.  This will be the last year that we present recordable injuries per car produced – which captures all injuries and  illness regardless of their severity or relation to work.

Other automakers have not yet adopted  this standard, so we are benchmarking against other manufacturing and service industries. We made this  change in response to studies indicating the statistical invalidity of previous metrics (Total Recordable Injury  Rate [TRIR]) as measures of safety outcomes.  We continue to concentrate our prevention and mitigation efforts in our highest risk areas across all lines of  business and are accelerating forward with our strategies to ensure essential safeguards are in place and  functioning. In 2020, COVID–19 impacted our operations including the shutdown of the Fremont Factory;  therefore, we are using 2021 as our baseline year.

Rather than uploading a Job Hazard Analysis (JHA) completed off-site, contractors and suppliers are now  expected to meet a Tesla Responsible Person and EHS&S professional at the location of work to complete a  Pre-Work Risk Assessment.  Over 5,000 companies were onboarded, and 587 Tesla Responsible Persons (TRP) and Contractor Responsible  Persons (CRP) were trained in the new process. This level of involvement resulted in increased contractor  responsibility, improved communication and more thorough Pre-Work Risk Assessments, which identified  critical and high-risk activities.  Shifting from a hazard-based approach to a risk-based approach provides a better opportunity for EHS&S  success by discussing critical and high-risk operations.  In addition, we support the Constructing Our Future with written procedures, training resources and forms  which are easily accessible to Tesla stakeholders. This strategic approach helps us create the framework  necessary to build safely, efficiently and consistently.  We are on schedule to release the new and improved supplier and contractor onboarding and management  system, Workforce Management, in the second quarter of 2022. This simple, scalable, centralized system will  build on the efficiencies of the interim onboarding process and provide better visibility for managers and  engineers to track performance.  We will report our contractor injury rates in the 2022 Impact Report.  ',\n",

       " '56  Introduction What Do We See As Impact?  The biggest environmental impact is achieved through early displacement of ICE vehicles and replacing them  with EVs. Additionally, we want to displace fossil-based energy generation with renewable energy generation.   As of the end of 2021, Tesla (including SolarCity prior to its 2016 acquisition by Tesla) has installed almost 4.0  Gigawatts of solar systems and cumulatively generated over 25.0 Terawatt-hours (TWhs) of emissions-free  electricity. For reference, that is more energy generated by our installations than the total energy Tesla has used  to run all our factories since we began producing Model S in 2012 and electricity used to power all of our  vehicles in that same period combined.  We are striving to always remain a net contributor to renewable energy generation. It is our goal to eventually  have all our manufacturing energy needs satisfied through renewable sources where possible. Additionally, we  are hoping to see more Tesla vehicle customers installing solar panels or Solar Roof along with a Powerwall to  meet their own energy needs in a sustainable way.

       " '57  Introduction In addition to an updated Lifecycle Analysis (LCA) for Model 3 and Model Y, we are reporting total Scope 1 and  Scope 2 emissions and use-phase emissions of our vehicles  In this year’s report we are reporting our Scope 1 (direct emissions from our facilities) and Scope 2 (purchased  electricity, heat, etc. for our facilities) emissions resulting from global operations. This information is not only  important to benchmark our performance against other manufacturers but is also the first step to track  progress as we continue to work to decarbonize our own operations. While the most important work we can do  to reduce GHG emissions is through selling as many of our products as possible, we are also committed to  reducing carbon emitted from our own operations longer term. This is not only the right thing to do, but it also  makes business sense as we reduce the resource intensity of our processes.   It is possible to fully decarbonize the manufacturing and use of EVs – this is economically unfeasible for ICE  vehicles  We are often asked if electric vehicles (EVs) are more sustainable than internal combustion engine (ICE)  vehicles. The environmental impact of zero-emission transport and energy products, like the products that Tesla  produces and sells, is undeniably more positive than the GHG-emitting alternatives. This becomes more  pronounced when determining the lifetime impact of EVs versus ICE vehicles, which requires looking at the  entire lifecycle — from raw materials to use-phase emissions to disposal — and not just at vehicle usage  emissions.  Variables often overlooked by other lifecycle studies:  ',\n",

Using only real-world data, not official NEDC, WLPT or EPA1 consumption data  The most important variable in a lifecycle analysis of an automobile is real-world fuel consumption or electricity  consumption, as applicable, which impacts the use-phase of the lifecycle. Various efficiency testing cycles such  as NEDC, WLTP or EPA do not truly represent real-world fuel or energy consumption. Therefore, we used:   EV energy consumption: Real world energy consumption based on 25 billion miles traveled Tesla Model 3 and  Model Y vehicles, including energy losses during the charging process.   ICE fuel consumption: Data provided by Consumer Reports, which reports model year 2020 mid-size premium  sedans achieve 24.3 MPG on average. This translates to over 400 grams of CO2e per mile once we account for  emissions generated through the extraction, refining and shipment of oil.  The carbon impact of ICE vehicles remains the same every year of use, but for EVs, it should improve every year  Based on publicly available sales and fleet data, we estimate that an average vehicle in the U.S. is driven slightly  less than 12,000 miles per year for about 17 years before it is scrapped. Furthermore, as an ICE vehicle ages, its  fuel efficiency only remains stable if serviced properly. On the other hand, electricity generation to charge EVs  has become “greener” over time with the addition of cleaner energy sources to the grid. Below, we show zero- emission electricity generation capacity (including nuclear) in the U.S. since 2015. Even without factoring in any  changes to federal policy or an acceleration of the adoption of renewables in the U.S. (which is likely), if current  trends remain stable, emissions generated through EV charging should continue to decline over time.  1NEDC = New European Driving Cycle; WLPT = Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure; EPA = U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 22021-2040 Tesla estimate based on recent grid mix shifts.

As more regions adopt sustainable energy solutions to  generate power, emissions related to charging an EV from the grid will decrease even further.  EV customers can increase their renewable energy mix by installing solar panels or a Solar Roof and an energy  storage solution, such as Powerwall, in their homes. This dramatically reduces the lifetime carbon footprint of an  EV, even when accounting for the carbon footprint of both the solar panel/Solar Roof and Powerwall  manufacturing and upstream supply chain.

       " '6 2  Despite a higher-emissions grid in China, Model 3 still has lower emissions than comparable ICE vehicles  In China, much of the grid is powered by coal. That said, even in this scenario, charging a Tesla Model 3Y from  the grid is still less emission intensive than running an ICE vehicle. Just like in Europe, we have assumed a  vehicle lifetime of 150,000 miles.  We are expecting the grid mix in China to improve dramatically over time as China remains a dominant deployer  and manufacturer of renewable energy. Sichuan Province (with a population of 81 million) is a great example of  this. In this province, given the high percentage of renewable energy penetration, charging an EV from the grid  is less polluting than charging an EV in most global countries or states.  In conclusion, even as of 2021, charging a Tesla Model 3Y in any of our major markets is more environmentally  friendly than burning gasoline. Considering that vehicles are used for 17 to 20 years before getting scrapped, it  is reasonable to assume that in the coming years, the gap in emissions per mile between EVs and ICEs will only  get wider.

Model Y All-Wheel Drive (AWD) achieves 4.1 EPA miles  / kWh, which makes it the most efficient electric SUV produced to date. The gap between Tesla AWD vehicle  efficiency continues to stand out compared to competitors in the same segment. While achieving the best-in- class energy efficiency, our AWD models can accelerate to 60 mph in just 4.2 seconds (4.8s for Model Y) and  reach a top speed of 145 mph (135 mph for Model Y). In isolation, high energy efficiency is already difficult to  achieve, but getting both performance and efficiency is the tricky part.  Tesla Robotaxis will be even more energy efficient  The energy efficiency of Tesla vehicles will continue to improve as we improve our technology and powertrain  efficiency. It is also reasonable to assume that our high-mileage products, such as our future Tesla Robotaxis,  will be designed for maximum energy efficiency as handling, acceleration and top speed become less relevant.  This will minimize cost for our customers as well as reduce the carbon footprint per mile driven.

For each component that requires less movement around the factory, and as we use fewer robots in the  vehicle production process, energy consumption declines.  In our quest for constant improvement, we build each new factory to be better and more sustainable than the  previous one. For example, at Gigafactory Texas, we chose highly efficient, insulated, low emissivity windows to  reduce building heating and cooling demand. In addition, waste heat recovery from our compressors alone will  offset over 1 MW of natural gas consumption for process heating. While we have already completed substantial  improvements at Gigafactory Shanghai, further improvements will continue at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg  and Gigafactory Texas.

For such  comparison, we look at actual energy usage for the HVAC system for the two modes under the same conditions  (operations in the factory, time of year, external temperature, etc.).

In order to reduce the cost of our vehicles and batteries, we also need  to use less energy to produce them. Many of the projects created to achieve this goal were showcased at our  Battery Day presentation in September 2020.  4.  Transitioning to in-house manufactured 4680 Tesla cells, whose production process can reduce energy  consumption by more than 70%  At Tesla’s 2020 Battery Day, we presented a novel way that cells can be manufactured using a dry electrode  process. Current electrode production processes involve mixing liquids with cathode or anode powders and  using massive machinery to coat and dry the electrode. Since this process involves large ovens, today’s cell  production consumes a lot of energy. The new dry-electrode process allows for the direct transition from a  cathode or anode powder to an electrode film, reducing energy consumption in the overall cell manufacturing  phase by more than 70% based on our latest analysis.  5.

We estimate that a vehicle gets scrapped after  approximately 200,000 miles of usage in the U.S. and roughly 150,000 miles in Europe. Creating a battery that  could last for 1,000,000 miles (4,000 charging cycles) would dramatically reduce the emissions per mile driven  for high-mileage vehicles such as taxis, delivery vans or trucks.  Producing Robotaxis is a core part of our mission. All vehicles in the world combined travel trillions of miles  every year. A relatively small number of vehicles, such as taxis, delivery vans, trucks and buses account for a  disproportionate amount of vehicle miles and, as a result, a disproportionate amount of emissions. A single  future Tesla vehicle with a million-mile battery could be utilized over five-times more than an average vehicle in  the U.S. After being fully optimized, and even once it is scrapped, a battery can still be recycled and its  materials used in a brand-new battery.  Reducing Carbon Footprint Even Further Increasing Vehicle Utilization  Note: Mileage is only one factor in battery capacity retention; battery age is also a major factor. Retention figures at lower mileages above likely  reflect the impact of age while higher mileage values, which come from high-utilization vehicles, likely reflect less influence from battery age.

       " '6 9  Scope 3 GHG emissions calculations are highly academic, even those widely used and accepted like the GHG  Protocol. Most companies lack primary data as it relates to their supply chain, product use and so on. Therefore,  most Scope 3 GHG emissions reporting is done using lofty assumptions as well as estimates from databases – this can lead to figures that are magnitudes off from the actual impact. Tesla has begun to measure the two  largest categories within our Scope 3 emissions: those from use of product and our supply chain.  Use of product emissions  Tesla has access to primary data from our over two million vehicles on the road and our fleet of solar and  storage products — we can calculate our emissions at a much higher level of accuracy than most manufactures  and can therefore develop emissions reduction solutions to match. This also means that we can calculate our use  of product emissions year on year — we do not have to estimate emissions over the lifetime of the vehicle  because we have primary data.  Supply chain emissions  Prioritizing our supply chain is crucial and we have a lot of work to do to incentivize suppliers to provide energy  and emissions data for us to report on. We have already started to identify which materials and processes in our  supply chain are key emitters so we can prioritize engagement and projects to address these emissions — see  the Supply Chain section for more detail.  The good thing for us is that Tesla’s high level of vertical integration and our direct sourcing relationships mean  we are positioned to manage upstream emissions better than most.  100% Renewable Supercharger network  Efficiency of an ICE vehicle does not improve throughout its lifetime. EVs will get cleaner over their lifetime as  the grid becomes greener. We will continue to look for ways to enable our customers to further reduce their  emissions beyond our vehicles — through solar and storage products and software to help differentiate when the  grid is greener and pulling more renewable energy like solar or wind.  The global Supercharger network was 100% renewable in 2021, achieved through a combination of onsite  resources and annual renewable matching. Additionally, all home charging in California was 100% renewable  through annual renewable matching. Therefore, the only emissions from the use of Tesla vehicles were a result of  home charging outside of California and use of third-party charging networks.  GHG Emissions Scope 3 Emissions   ',\n",

Electrifying the  heavy-duty truck segment is an essential part of transitioning the world to sustainable energy.  Payload equal to a diesel truck  With both the U.S. and E.U. having approved higher weight allowances for electric heavy-duty trucks, we expect  the payload to be at least as high as it would be for a diesel truck. In the E.U., electric semi trucks are allowed to  be 2 tons (~4,400 pounds) heavier than diesel equivalents, and in the U.S. the allowance is 0.9 tons (2,000  pounds). When fully loaded, the Tesla Semi should be able to achieve over 500 miles of range, achieved through  aerodynamics and highly efficient motors. This truck will be able to reach an efficiency of over 0.5 miles per  kWh.  While most heavy trucking journeys are shorter than 500 miles, we want long-distance hauling to also be  sustainable. We are in the process of developing a Semi charger network at trucking rest stops across the U.S.  and Europe, where each Tesla Semi could top up their range.

       " '7 2  Waste Generated Per Vehicle Manufactured As we build more efficient factories, our waste per vehicle decreases  Building localized factories both makes sense economically and reduces waste. First, because the automotive  supply chain doesn’t have a strong presence on the West Coast of the U.S., many components need to be  shipped from long distances, requiring excessive packaging and creating more waste than necessary.  Second, modern factories are better designed for material flow. Trailer entry points surround the whole factory,  which means that components can be offloaded precisely at the part of the factory where they are needed. Less  material flow results in less waste, because a shorter journey requires less protective packaging. The chart  below shows that waste generation per vehicle at Gigafactory Shanghai is less than half of what it is in the U.S.  We are expecting our upcoming factories such as Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas to  continue the same trend.  Any materials that are possible to recycle, we recycle  The vast majority of generated waste, such as paper, plastics and metals, is recyclable. At Gigafactory Shanghai,  for example, just 7% of total waste generated in 2021 was not recyclable.  We push for innovative approaches to reducing waste, which includes reduction of non-recyclable materials in  the first place, learning from local factories and deploying improvements globally or working with our logistics  team to minimize shipments and packaging per vehicle.

Our data  shows this is not the case. While each automaker may draw their boundaries slightly differently (depending on  how vertically integrated they are), according to the latest publicly available figures, Tesla withdrew less water  at facilities dedicated to vehicle manufacturing per vehicle produced than the majority of established  carmakers. Furthermore, the efficient manufacturing design we are implementing at our new factories in Texas  and Berlin-Brandenburg will result in further reductions in our water usage per vehicle. Our goal is to have  industry-leading low water usage per vehicle, even when accounting for cell manufacturing. The below chart  includes our latest estimates for water usage per vehicle at those facilities.  Water usage and power generation  While many recognize the impact that power generation has on GHG emissions, its impact on water  consumption is less appreciated. Power generation is one of the leading causes of water withdrawal in the U.S.,  as water for thermoelectric power is used to generate electricity with steam-driven turbine generators and to  cool power-producing equipment. This means that every kilowatt-hour (kWh) of clean solar energy produced  not only lowers GHG emissions, but also lowers water consumption.  *Latest estimate for water consumption based on factory design.

       " '74  Tesla factories are setting a new standard of water use per vehicle  Water is becoming increasingly scarce as the climate changes. That is why we are reducing our water usage  throughout our operations as much as possible. We have prioritized direct use in manufacturing and will  continue to explore the rest of our impact throughout the supply chain and in sales, service and delivery.  The “cooling tower makeup” is the single biggest contributor to water usage in any car factory after paint  operations. As water that cools machinery evaporates, it needs to be topped up regularly. The total cooling  tower makeup could be offset entirely by non-potable sources such as rainwater or wastewater. These are some  of the initiatives we are taking at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and/or Gigafactory Texas in order to reduce  water consumption per complete vehicle (including cells).  1. Water intensive process optimization: We are constantly looking into reducing water consumption by  optimizing or eliminating water intensive production processes across our operations. At Gigafactory Berlin- Brandenburg, we use hybrid cooling towers, have eliminated quench tanks in casting and introduced cascade  rinsing systems in the paint shop and battery can wash process for cell manufacturing.  2. Rainwater and condensate harvesting and reuse: We are planning to capture at least 25% of roof runoff (1  million square feet) to a central underground storage system within Gigafactory Texas. Rainwater will be  recycled for use in the cooling of manufacturing equipment. In an average year, such systems should save an  estimated 7.5 million gallons of potable city water. Additionally, as hot, humid outdoor air is conditioned, water  condenses out of the air. Typically, this condensate is discarded as wastewater. At Gigafactory Texas, we reuse  this condensate in our cooling towers and process water systems to offset incoming site water.  3. Reclaimed and recycled water (wastewater reuse): Using local treated wastewater could result in offsetting  the entire annual cooling tower makeup water demand with non-drinkable uses. At Gigafactory Texas, this could  result in an estimated 40 million gallons of potable city water conserved annually. Reclaimed water is available  and under investigation for use at both Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg.  Water Used Per Vehicle Manufactured Initiatives at Our Factories  ',\n",

In order to meet various countries’  emission targets and avoid government fines, polluting companies pay non-polluting companies through credit  purchases. The goal of this system is for every OEM to be incentivized to reduce emissions and themselves  become non-polluting by selling more of their own manufactured EVs instead of paying another company for  their non-polluting credits.   Emissions credit revenue is used for EV capacity expansion, which in turn displaces ICEs  In 2021, we generated almost $1.5 billion in revenue selling zero-emission regulatory credits to other OEMs.  Proceeds from such sales will go towards building new factories to produce EVs that will continue to displace  ICE vehicles. While it is common practice today for ICE vehicle OEMs to purchase regulatory credits from other  companies (such as Tesla) to offset their total GHG emissions, it is not a sustainable strategy. In order to meet  increasingly strict regulatory requirements across the world, OEMs will be forced to develop truly competitive  EVs.  EV sales by all carmakers need to accelerate, taking market share from ICEs  In 2021, Tesla delivered almost 1 million EVs globally. We hope that every car manufacturer will strive to produce  hundreds of thousands of EVs per year, as significant reduction of emissions will only be achieved if all  carmakers push for an industry-wide shift to EVs.

In order to  convince consumers to buy our products, they need to be better in every way – performance, cost of ownership,  safety, fun and more. We want to make products that people love.  Model 3 is the first EV to be priced on-par with ICE vehicle equivalents  Model 3 is the first EV in history priced competitively with its gas-powered equivalents, even before taking into  consideration any regional subsidies and lower running costs. Unfortunately, most other EVs on the market  today are often priced at over a $10,000 premium compared to their direct ICE vehicle equivalents.

While the “sticker price” of Model 3 is similar to  an equivalent BMW or Audi, the sticker price of a vehicle itself is only one of many cost items that need to be  considered. The lifetime running costs of EVs are lower than those of ICE vehicles due to lower maintenance  costs, cheap electricity and high residual value of used Tesla vehicles, the latter of which has remained  exceptionally strong since our initial launch. As a result, Tesla Model 3 has a base price similar to BMW 3 Series,  but the total cost of ownership per mile is closer to America’s best-selling sedan, the Toyota Camry*.  Cost data is based on data collected from our fleet  The advantage of having a fleet of vehicles that is constantly online is the ability to analyze real-world data  rather than only being able to use estimates. We have an extensive database of Model 3 residual values and cost  of repairs, maintenance, energy use, etc.  Additionally, the insurance cost for the Model 3 RWD below is based on  the projected median insurance rate in the U.S. for Tesla Model 3 drivers. Our analysis shows that over five years  and 60,000 miles, running a Model 3 RWD costs 63 cents per mile.

Our data shows  that Tesla vehicles are being driven more than average vehicles in the U.S., suggesting that they are generally  being used as a customer’s primary vehicle. We fundamentally believe that you shouldn’t have to choose  between price, quality, usability and sustainability. An EV should be the best vehicle in every way, so consumers  don’t ever need to use ICE vehicles.  The longer the range, the higher the usage  There is a clear relationship between range, how often an EV is utilized and whether it is a primary-use vehicle.  The more confident owners are that their EV can be used for commuting, errands and long road trips, the less  they will feel they need to supplement their EV with an ICE vehicle.

To ensure we replace as many ICE vehicles  with EVs as possible, we have been focused on increasing the range of Tesla vehicles. While most personal  vehicle journeys are relatively short, and thus drivable on a single charge, consumers do not buy cars that can  meet most of their driving needs; they buy a car that meets all their driving needs.  The longer the range, the lower the Supercharger use  Since its introduction in 2012, we have increased the range of the Model S by over 50%: from 265 miles to 405  miles of range for the long-range version. Our focus on energy efficiency — achieving superior range from the  same size battery — has allowed to us continue to increase range while keeping the battery size relatively  stable. Our data shows that the longer the range of our vehicles, the less Supercharging Tesla customers do.  After all, day trips of over 400 miles are quite rare.  Super-fast charging: V3 Superchargers can increase range by up to 200 miles in just 15 minutes  Around 300 miles of range at highway speeds is equal to roughly four hours of driving. At that stage, drivers  are often likely to take a break. We want to make sure that such a break can be relatively short before  continuing the journey. Our latest generation of Superchargers can recover up to 200 miles of range in just 15  minutes of charging, long enough for a quick break and snack.  Substantial coverage and 99.96% reliability  We’re aware that the chart showing Supercharger uptime looks silly, but that’s kind of the point. While coverage  is important, uptime is essential. Few things are as frustrating as arriving to a charging station with a near- empty battery, realizing that none of the charging plugs are working.

We recently introduced active safety features that go beyond the norm:  Traffic Light & Stop Sign Warning  When a driver doesn’t notice a red light or a stop sign, our cars will notice that vehicle’s speed is too high.  Thanks to our eight-camera system, each vehicle can recognize a traffic light that is specific to vehicle’s  trajectory as well as a stop sign. A loud warning is triggered to alert the driver.  Pedal Misapplication Mitigation (accelerator pressed inadvertently)  Pressing the accelerator pedal when the circumstances indicate you should be pressing the brake instead, like  when pulling into a parking space, is relatively common no matter what vehicle you're in. However, if you are in  a Tesla, when our cameras recognize an object in front of the car, “Pedal Misapplication Mitigation” system cuts  torque from the electric motor to prevent a collision if you happen to press hard on the accelerator. This  technology has prevented or mitigated hundreds of collisions every month.  Active avoidance of lane departure or a blind-spot collision  If a driver is changing into a lane while a vehicle in the blind spot is entering the same lane, or if our vehicle  starts departing its lane without an indicator, our vehicles will sound a warning and assist the steering to avoid a  collision.

Tesla is also sharing  data and statistics collected by our vehicles with select regulatory bodies and external research organizations — in an anonymized fashion or with consent and in accordance with local data privacy laws — giving them access  to an unprecedented opportunity to understand crashes in the real world. This access to data will accelerate  impact safety research, driving change across the safety industry and improved safety outcomes for all vehicles  to protect lives.  Post-Crash Data Analysis  After we send new software to the fleet, we wait for new data to come through to understand the efficacy of  the system once it is deployed in the real world. Since deployment of our ‘offzone’ side algorithm (data-driven  safety), we learned that of the total vehicles that had their airbags deployed, 15% of those deployed due to our  new algorithm in these new modes. This confirms our expectations and highlights how effective fleet-based  learnings and rapid deployment of novel solutions can be.   Why Airbags Sometimes Don’t Deploy  In a fairly common “small overlap” collision as the one shown below, front sensors are unlikely to pick up a side  collision, as they are usually designed to detect a frontal collision. And side sensors are usually too close to a  driver window to detect a collision far in the front. We designed our sensors and their positions in a way that  they can pick up nearly every type of collision and deploy airbags if necessary.

Added benefit of enhanced performance  Based on the advanced architecture of Model S and Model X, we engineered Model 3 and Model Y to be some  of the safest cars built to date, anywhere. Even though Model 3 and Model Y have no engine, their performance  is similar to a “mid-engine internal combustion car” due to a centered battery pack and the fact that the rear  motor is placed slightly in front of the rear axle rather than behind it. Not only does this architecture add to the  overall agility and handling of the car, but it also improves stability control effectiveness by minimizing  rotational kinetic energy.  Model 3 and Model Y score 5-stars in all USNCAP categories   After putting Model 3 and Model Y through a series of crash tests used as part of the New Car Assessment  Program to calculate the likelihood of serious bodily injury for front, side and rollover crashes, the National  Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) awarded each top safety ratings of 5-stars in every category  and subcategory.

A single Megapack has on average 3,000 kWh worth of battery storage  capacity, and given its scalability, enables projects over 1,000,000 kWh. Tesla Energy continues to be  dependent on the global supply chain, including cell supply. In 2021, in order to meet demand that is well in  excess of supply for energy storage products, Tesla began building a new production facility capable of  producing 40,000,000 kWh of energy storage per year.

Tesla is a one-stop shop for taking our  customers off-grid by covering a large variety of their needs. In 2021, Tesla sold 4 GWh worth of energy storage  products, more than 15% of the 25 GWh global market*. Some of these projects were massive deployments,  including a 371 MWh installation in California and a 497 MWh installation in Victoria, Australia. In order to switch  global energy usage to renewable sources, we estimate that global annual battery storage production will need  to increase to ~10,000 GWh.  Residential customers: Solar Roof, solar panels and Powerwall  Anyone can dramatically reduce their carbon footprint by installing Solar Roof or solar panels with Powerwall.  In theory, all U.S. domestic electricity needs, as well as vehicle transportation needs, could be met by sunlight  alone. Naturally, installation of such a system needs to make financial sense for the customer. In Massachusetts,  for example, we estimate that an average solar and storage system pays for itself with energy cost savings  within approximately 10 years.

       " '9 5  What do we see as impact?  Protecting human rights and the environment is core to our procurement strategy. Tesla creates our products  from many different materials and components, some of which we purchase from our direct (Tier 1) suppliers.  Many of our Tier 1 suppliers do not purchase all their raw materials directly, rather they get them from their  suppliers and sub-suppliers around the world through a complex supply chain. Though we believe that battery  recycling will play a critical role in supplying a portion of these materials to enable a closed loop supply chain,  we recognize that global battery cell production will continue to rely heavily on primary, mined materials to  meet the growing demand for our products.  In line with our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy, Tesla is committed to ensuring  that companies in our supply chain respect human rights and protect the environment. Our goal is that where  Tesla’s supply chain touches, local conditions for stakeholders continuously improve as a result of our  purchases. Our responsible sourcing strategy has the following objectives:  1. Increase the share of materials we source directly from suppliers, and those closer to our factories  (supply chain localization); and    2. Continue to source globally, to contribute to the improvement of local conditions in our sourcing  communities.   Mapping GHG emissions in the battery supply chain is one of our top priorities  Upstream GHG emissions from manufacturing an EV battery – from raw material extraction through refining and  transportation of materials – can be meaningful. We estimate that these specific activities cause up to ~80% of  the total emissions of a Model 3 battery pack, with the largest contributors at the chemical processing stage.  Our battery supply chain GHG emissions hotspot analysis – an industry first – is on page 104 of this report.

       " '9 6  Extracting raw  materials  A common question we receive is: “What happens to Tesla battery packs once they reach the end of their life?”  An important distinction between fossil fuels and lithium-ion batteries as an energy source is that while fossil  fuels are extracted and used once, the materials in a lithium-ion battery are recyclable. When petroleum is  pumped out of the ground, chemically refined and then burned, it releases toxic emissions into the atmosphere  that are not recoverable for reuse. Battery materials, in contrast, are refined and put into a cell and will remain in  the cell at the end of their life when they can be recycled to recover valuable materials for reuse, repeatedly.  Longer battery longevity is the most sustainable option  Battery pack life extension is the superior option to recycling for both environmental and business reasons.  Before decommissioning and recycling a consumer battery pack, Tesla does everything it can to extend the  useful life of each pack, including sending out over-the-air software updates to Tesla vehicles to improve battery  efficiency when our engineers find new ways to do so. In addition, any battery that is no longer meeting a  customer’s needs can be serviced at a Tesla Service Center.  Every battery used in R&D or returned from the field that cannot be re-manufactured is recycled  Tesla batteries, including the battery packs in our vehicles and our energy storage products, are made to last  many years, and therefore, we have received a limited number of them back from the field. Most batteries that  Tesla recycles today are pre-consumer, coming to us through R&D and quality control. None of our scrapped  lithium-ion batteries go to landfills and 100% are recycled. Furthermore, Tesla has an established internal  ecosystem to re-manufacture batteries coming from the field to our Service Centers. We actively implement  circular economy principles and consider all other options before opting for battery recycling.  The small number of post-consumer batteries that we receive are primarily generated from our fleet of vehicles  on the road, predominantly from taxi-like vehicles. Since we have only been producing Model S (our oldest  model) for approximately ten years, and our energy storage products for even less time, it will likely be some  time before we start receiving back vehicle batteries in larger volumes.  Supply Chain  Recycling  ',\n",
       " '9 7  While Tesla works with third-party recyclers, we also recycle in-house  In 2020, Tesla successfully installed the first phase of our cell recycling facility at Gigafactory Nevada for in- house processing of both battery manufacturing scrap and end-of-life batteries. While Tesla has worked for  years with third-party battery recyclers to ensure our batteries do not end up in a landfill, we understand the  importance of also building recycling capacity in-house to supplement these relationships. On-site recycling  brings us one step closer to closing the loop on materials generation, allowing for raw material transfer straight  to our nickel and cobalt suppliers. The facility unlocks the cycle of innovation for battery recycling at scale,  allowing Tesla to rapidly improve current designs through operational learnings and to perform process testing  of R&D products. By the end of 2021, this facility achieved a production rate of over 50 tons of recycled material  per week.  Every Tesla battery factory will recycle batteries on-site  As the manufacturer of our in-house cell program, we are best positioned to recycle our products efficiently to  maximize key battery material recovery. With the implementation of in-house cell manufacturing at Gigafactory  Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas, we expect substantial increases in manufacturing scrap globally. We  intend to tailor recycling solutions to each location and thereby re-introduce valuable materials back into our  manufacturing process. Our goal is to develop a safe recycling process with high recovery rates, low costs and  low environmental impact. From an economic perspective, we expect to recognize significant savings over the  long term as the costs associated with large-scale battery material recovery and recycling will be far lower than  purchasing additional raw materials for cell manufacturing.  Global annual amount of lithium-ion battery metals sent for  recycling  1,500 Tons of Nickel  300 Tons of Copper  200 Tons of Cobalt  A closed-loop battery recycling process presents a  compelling solution to move energy supply away from the  fossil-fuel based practice of take, make and burn, to a more  circular model of recycling end-of-life batteries for reuse over  and over again.

       " '9 8  We have high expectations for our suppliers  Tesla is committed to ensuring that our suppliers operate responsibly. We do this by proactively identifying and  addressing potential risks in our supply chains. The Tesla Supplier Code of Conduct, Human Rights Policy and  Responsible Materials Policy outline Tesla’s expectations for suppliers.   We established a responsible sourcing program based on international best practices   Our responsible sourcing program is based on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Mineral  Supply Chains. Tesla collects data from its supply chain (including through audits), translates this data into on- the-ground actions and discloses the outcomes in our annual Impact Report.

       " '9 9  Prioritization of cobalt, lithium and nickel  Given their unique significance to the success of EVs and energy storage, Tesla has a dedicated responsible  sourcing program for three priority minerals in the battery supply chain: cobalt, nickel and lithium. We prioritize  these raw materials for the following reasons:  1. Commercial importance: Cobalt, lithium and nickel are the key raw materials used in cathode production,  represent about a third of the total costs of a battery cell and play an essential function in improving vehicle  range and safety performance.  2. Potential environmental and social impact and scrutiny: Cobalt, lithium and nickel are also ‘minerals’ – in that  they are raw materials that are produced through different methods of mining around the world, often  concentrated in countries that face socio-economic and environmental challenges. As known global reserves  are depleted, these minerals are becoming increasingly scarce, and companies look to access resources in  more remote and challenging locations to meet global demand. Cobalt, lithium and nickel are also classified  as critical minerals by the United States, European Union and Canadian governments because they are  essential in enabling a transition away from fossil fuels to a low-carbon economy. As a result, the impact of  mining activity on the environment and local communities lends itself to greater environmental and social  scrutiny from civil society, policymakers and investors.  Mining has an important role to play in the transition to sustainable energy and we engage with suppliers to  ensure mining is done in a responsible way. This is one of the reasons Tesla joined the Initiative for Responsible  Mining Assurance (IRMA) and uses the IRMA Standard as well as other internationally recognized responsible  mining standards in our due diligence.  Battery Supply Chain #1 The Tesla Approach  ',\n",
       " '1 0 0  The unique Tesla approach: Going directly to the source  The implementation of an OECD-aligned approach for cobalt, nickel and lithium is underpinned by the following  two pillars:  1. Direct sourcing from mining companies: While cobalt, nickel and lithium go through multiple processing  steps by different companies, some of the more important environmental and social risks in this supply chain  are present at mine sites. Direct sourcing from mining companies allows Tesla to engage directly in local  contexts instead of having to rely on multiple midstream companies that typically sit between EV makers  and mining. It also enables more transparent and traceable supply chains and better environmental and  social data. In 2021, Tesla procured >95% of lithium hydroxide, >50% of cobalt and >30% of nickel for nickel- containing (NCA and NCM) cells directly from nine mining and chemicals companies. All nine binding  contracts include environmental and social requirements. As Tesla’s battery supply chain continues to scale,  Tesla expects the proportion of directly sourced minerals to increase.  2. Direct local engagement: Building on direct supplier engagement, Tesla seeks to contribute to the  continuous improvement of conditions in communities affected by operations in Tesla’s supply chain,  informed by engagement with local experts, community organizations and civil society.  Battery Supply Chain #1 The Tesla Approach  >95%  Lithium hydroxide sourced directly  >50% Cobalt sourced directly  >30% Nickel sourced directly  ',\n",
       " '1 0 1  Our diversified cathode strategy  Tesla’s batteries today contain a variety of different cathode chemistries, including nickel-cobalt-aluminum  (NCA) and nickel-cobalt-manganese (NCM) for higher energy applications and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) for  lower energy applications. Tesla will continue to advance a diversified cathode strategy for LFP, nickel-rich and  manganese-rich cathodes to address various market segments for vehicle and energy storage products and  provide future flexibility based on raw materials availability and pricing. To put this into context, lithium only  accounts for roughly 1.5% of the full battery pack weight. Additionally, iron phosphate battery packs contain no  cobalt or nickel.   While the relative cathode compositions and our overall demand of various minerals and battery-grade  chemicals will continue to evolve, Tesla and the global battery supply chain will require significant quantities of  responsibly produced lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese, iron, phosphates and many other minerals for the  foreseeable future. While we recognize the critical role battery recycling will play in supplying a portion of these  materials to enable a closed loop supply chain, global cell production will continue to rely heavily on primary,  mined materials to meet the growing demand in the short to medium term. The availability and affordability of  these minerals and chemicals are key to advancing Tesla’s mission and accelerating the transition to sustainable  energy. We will continue to collaborate with our suppliers and upstream producers in providing visibility to  enable the scale up of key battery minerals.  For cells containing NCA and NCM cathodes, we continue to work toward batteries that contain higher levels of  nickel in order to improve vehicle range while lowering overall battery costs, without compromising overall cell  performance, such as battery safety and lifetime, that is currently enabled by cobalt. It is important to note that  we expect our absolute cobalt demand to increase over the coming years because our vehicle and cell  production growth rate is forecasted to outpace the overall rate of cobalt reduction on a per cell basis.

The pilot project showed that mining and upstream processing  had a higher CO2e intensity than precursor, cathode and battery cell production.  Building on this hotspot analysis and pilot project, Tesla developed a data collection methodology aligned with  the GHG Protocol – a globally recognized standard for measuring GHG emissions – and informed by the  European Product Environmental Footprint methodology and the Product Environmental Footprint Category  Rules (PEFCR) guidance for batteries — a set of rules developed by the European Union on calculating product- specific environmental footprint. Instead of relying on estimates or aggregate data from third parties, Tesla’s  ambition is to collect as much primary data from Tesla’s suppliers as possible to get the most accurate  understanding of GHG emissions hotspots and therefore, how to reduce emissions.

       " '1 1 2  Tesla’s Supplier Audit program  In 2018, Tesla initiated its Supplier Audit program with the objective to extend our supplier performance  evaluation to key environmental and social impact metrics relevant to Tesla’s business. This program extension  was introduced at the time when Tesla was transitioning from a small automotive manufacturer to a company  gaining recognition as the leader in electrical vehicle production. We recognized that this growth came with an  increased ability to impact positive change on the practices of our suppliers, but also with an increased  responsibility to drive such change in line with our mission statement. During the program pilot phase, we  focused our efforts on suppliers that we deemed high risk based on their industry or the use of potentially  dangerous processes and/or chemicals in the manufacturing of our parts.  We chose to utilize the Responsible Business Alliance’s (RBA) Validated Assessment Program (VAP) as the  basis for our audits. The RBA’s VAP is an audit protocol globally recognized for its breadth of topics and  stringent requirements for supplier completion. It covers nearly 200 checkpoints across labor, health and safety,  environmental, ethical and management system topics. Audits are conducted by independent third parties that  are approved by the RBA, and all auditors must undergo training by the RBA on the audit standard and its  implementation ensuring a globally and industry-wide standardized approach.  In any case where any priority non-conformance (the most significant type) occurs, our audit procedures  require that suppliers undergo a closure audit. These closure audits – which are a follow up to the original audit  where the non-conformances were identified – allow suppliers to address all non-conformances in the earlier  audits. Additional audits, rather than an immediate suspension of the business relationship, are preferred to  improve working conditions and reduce the risk of continued deficiencies.  As of the end of 2021, we had a total of 152 supplier locations go through our supplier audit at least once,  representing 144 suppliers, or 10% of 2021 spend with our direct supply base. As part of these audits over 4,000  supplier employee interviews were conducted.  Responsible Sourcing Supplier Audit Program  ',\n",
       " '1 1 3  Continuing to expand our audit program  In 2021, Tesla redefined its criteria for determining which of our suppliers are subject to the Supplier Audit  program. While in its initial stages the suppliers subject to the audit were mainly located in China, and the  updated criteria expanded the scope to include significantly more suppliers globally. When we started our audit  program, we had only just announced our plans for Gigafactory Shanghai. We now have six factories across  three different continents, and our production volume of vehicles has grown exponentially. As our global  footprint and manufacturing grew, so did our supply base. Therefore, the expansion of our audit program was  an important step to ensure that our supplier due diligence efforts continue to reflect the realities of our supply  chain and can properly identify and address potential risks within our supply base.  The criteria on which suppliers are selected to undergo the Supplier Audit is based on an expanded risk  assessment approach, looking at Tesla’s exposure to suppliers financially, as well as suppliers’ location. This  criteria determines which suppliers are obligated to undergo an audit, but additional suppliers can be  nominated by our commercial and supplier industrialization teams where they see value in doing so or the  potential to further mitigate risk. With the expanded audit program scope, we are targeting to cover over 50%  of our global spend with our direct supply base.  As part of our program expansion, we are building on our ability to influence supplier behavior in a positive  way. When a supplier is not meeting our expectations, they are obligated to implement corrective action plans  to remedy any deficiencies or non-conformances found during the audit process, regardless of the severity. In  cases of the highest priority non-conformances, suppliers are required to undergo closure audits to ensure that  their corrective action plans have been fully implemented. In cases of less severe non-conformances, suppliers  are still required to develop and implement corrective action plans as well as provide evidence to Tesla that  those plans have been fully implemented within our expected timelines.  Furthermore, we defined a separate category called Zero Tolerance Violations, which, for example, include any  violations related to the use of forced or child labor and inhumane treatment of workers. In cases where such  instances are discovered, our supply chain leadership will be informed, and a corrective action plan will be  developed immediately, together with the supplier. Tesla will transition away from the supplier relationship if the  supplier is unable or unwilling to correct the identified issues and improve their operations within a reasonable  time frame.

       " '1 1 4  How we identify and prioritize risks in our supply chain  Our Supplier Audit program is an important part of our efforts to identify and address environmental and social  risks within our supply chain. These audits allow for a snapshot of a supplier facility’s programs and procedures,  but also sets a baseline for future evaluations. Additionally, Tesla utilizes other avenues to evaluate potential  risks in our supply chain such as those detailed below.  We engaged with several third-party service providers allowing us to continually monitor our supply chain for  emerging issues that may affect our suppliers. These include issues related to labor relations, human rights and  environmental degradation. This monitoring allows our Global Supply Managers to be notified as soon as  information about suppliers becomes public and act by engaging directly with the supplier to understand their  plans for correcting the identified risk.  Tesla follows the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct when identifying risks within  our supply chain. We require suppliers to cooperate with our efforts and assist in identifying and removing  practices within our supply chain that are contradictory to our policies. Our responsible sourcing policies  require suppliers to provide requested information regarding potential violations of our policies. Furthermore,  we continue to leverage our membership with the RBA to identify upcoming supply chain risks as well as  understand industry best practices to address them. We are actively involved with the RMI as well as specific  action groups within the organization. In addition, we have utilized many of the RBA tools, such as country risk  analysis to understand inherent risks in our supply chain and RBA-Online to collect information on corporate  and factory-specific supplier performance.  Responsible Sourcing Identifying Priorities  ',\n",
       " \"1 1 5  Across all audits, we found no instances of child labor, forced labor or inhumane treatment of workers  The table below details findings of our audits across all suppliers regardless of severity and includes initial  audits as well as closure audits. Through July 2021, our suppliers have addressed and remedied 100% of priority  non-conformances, with the remaining open priority findings to be addressed in upcoming closure audits. Our  initial focus on high-risk suppliers allowed us to cover more than 70% of this group in the first three years of the  audit program and gave us an understanding of suppliers to prioritize in an expanded program.   In all audits conducted at Tesla's request at supplier manufacturing facilities producing Tesla products, we found  no instances of child labor, forced labor or inhumane treatment.  In 2021, the five most common findings were related to (% of total findings within each category)2: 1. Working Hours (20.4%): no more than 60 hours work per week, overtime is voluntary, one day off per seven   days 2. Emergency Preparedness (11.1%):  proper permitting, emergency risk assessment at 11.1% of total findings;  3. Wages and Benefits (9.4%): proper calculation of regular and overtime wages, timely payment of wages;  4. Occupational Safety (7.5%): availability of PPE, proper permitting; and  5. Freely Chosen Employment (5.5%): contract provided in worker’s native language, no excessive penalty for   leaving position   Responsible Sourcing Supplier Audit Findings  1 Over the past two years, global pandemic conditions have significantly impacted our suppliers’ ability to schedule on-site audits, leading to a  decrease in our annual audit numbers. 2 The colors of percentages above indicate their inclusion in broader categories in the table.

We are committed to establishing an operating framework  that exercises appropriate oversight of responsibilities at all levels throughout the company and manages its  affairs consistent with high principles of business ethics.  11 - 12  Our Approach to Corporate  Governance  Our unique business requires a unique approach to corporate governance. And our mission requires a long-term  focus that we believe will ultimately maximize value to our employees and our stockholders. Our corporate  governance structure has facilitated several key decisions which might have appeared counter-intuitive to some,  but which have set up the Tesla to achieve long-term success.  13  Board Committees (as of March 1,  2022)  The Board has four standing committees — the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Nominating  and Corporate Governance Committee and the Disclosure Controls Committee — which are each further  described in this section.   14 - 15  Compensation Philosophy  Our compensation philosophy reflects our long-term mission and our startup origins. We emphasize structuring  compensation to reward our named executive officers based on performance, and equity awards weigh heavily in  our named executive officers’ total compensation, including awards that vest upon the achievement of clear and  measurable milestones.   16  Data Privacy and Cybersecurity  Tesla builds products with privacy and security at their core. Additionally, managing data privacy is a shared task  through all levels of our organization. Our privacy principles are: 1. We build privacy into our products from start  to finish; 2. We give customers choices about their data; 3. We maintain trust through transparency; and 4. We  safeguard personal data.  17 - 18  Human Rights  The ethical treatment of all people and regard for human rights is core to our mission of a sustainable future. We  believe all businesses within our supply chain have a responsibility to share our respect for human rights. Our  human rights policy is the formalization of our commitment to uphold and respect these rights and the values  they represent. We have a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to child or forced labor and human trafficking by  our suppliers.  19 - 20  ',\n",
       " \"1 1 8  Summary – People and Culture  Topic Description Page(s)  Introduction Tesla's employees are its greatest asset and critical to achieving our mission. Our People Strategy is centered on  providing meaningful work, a respectful, safe, inclusive and equitable workplace, compensating our people well,  and making our benefits an outlier.  22  Attracting Employees  Our employee count has grown ~70 fold over the past decade and, in just over ten years, created nearly 100,000  direct jobs. Whether it is through our direct hiring opportunities, internships or workforce development  programs, interest in joining Tesla’s mission is at an all-time high. We had more than 3,000,000 unique  applicants globally in 2021 alone.  23 - 27  Compensating Employees  Tesla provides a highly competitive wage that meets or exceeds the wages of comparable manufacturing roles,  even before equity and benefits are factored in, and we want our benefits to be an outlier in the manufacturing  industry. We have an annual pay equity program in place, designed to assess whether similarly situated  employees are paid in a similar manner after accounting for a range of variables.   28 - 32  Retaining Employees  As Model 3 has become the best-selling premium sedan globally and our profitability (operating margin) has rose  to the highest in the industry, employee satisfaction has improved. This has fueled our ability to expand  dramatically and provide career opportunities for many strong performers. As nearly 70% of our leadership is  promoted from within Tesla, our employees are surrounded by examples of successful progression.   33 - 34  Diversity, Equity and Inclusion  We are proud to be a majority-minority company with a large representation of employees from communities  that have long struggled to break through the historic roadblocks to equal opportunity in the U.S. As of  December 31, 2020, 34% of our directors and vice presidents are people of color. This year we published our  latest EEO-1 data for the first time.  35 - 41  Respectful Workplace We strive to create an environment where people love to come to work every day. With over 100,000  employees as of March 2022, challenges arise, and we address them head on. In 2021, we re-doubled our efforts  to educate employees and managers that any form of discrimination must be reported.   42 - 43  Employee Engagement Employee engagement drives productivity, satisfaction and loyalty and plays a critical role in employee  retention. Tesla’s engagement initiatives strive to make employees feel informed, valued and respected, while  company-wide open-door policies with leaders empower employees to make their ideas heard.   44  Disaster Relief  We are committed to providing disaster relief through product donations. Our disaster relief efforts have  provided 100% clean, emissions free emergency power to people in Ukraine, New Orleans after Hurricane Ida,  and Kentucky and Texas after sever winter storms. We also provided free supercharging to customers in  countries surrounding Ukraine.   45 - 46  Environmental, Health, Safety and  Security  In 2021, our focus remained on protecting people, the planet, our property and products. We recently deployed  our new EHS&S system – MyEHS – in order to better collect and manage data, allowing us to make decision that  reduce risk. Furthermore, in 2021, our ATSM Global Serious Injury Rate remained below the industry average.  47 - 54  \",\n",
       " \"1 1 9  Summary – Environmental Impact  Topic Description Page(s)  Lifecycle Analysis of Tesla Vehicles  versus Average ICE  Regardless of where they are driven (U.S., Europe or China), a Model 3 and Model Y emit far fewer greenhouse  gas emissions per mile than a comparable ICE. Moving the grid toward more renewables and making our  operations and supply chain less GHG intensive will only make this dynamic more pronounced as time goes on.  56 – 67  GHG Emissions: Scope 1, 2, 3  We have disclosed our full Scope 1 and Scope 2 (location-based) emissions this year. We have also disclosed the  amount of CO2e emitted through the use of our vehicles (part of Scope 3). The global Supercharger network and  home charging in California were both 100% renewable in 2021, achieved through a combination of onsite  resources (for the Supercharger network only) and annual renewable matching.   68 – 69  NOx, Particulates and Other Pollutants New research shows that fossil fuels are alone responsible for more than 8 million premature deaths annually, or  almost one out of every five deaths globally, double previous estimates. Zero tailpipe emissions is a commonly  overlooked benefit of EVs.  70  Tesla Semi's Impact on Emissions Tesla Semi is poised to make a large impact: in the U.S., combination trucks make up just 1.1% of the vehicle fleet  but account for 17.9% of annual emissions. 71  Waste Generated per Vehicle  Manufactured  As we continue to build new, more efficient factories our ability to limit packaging and reduce waste increases.  Waste generated per vehicle in Shanghai production is 60% less than our manufacturing in the U.S. We continue  to push for innovative approaches to reducing waste as we expand our global operations.  72  Water Used per Vehicle Manufactured Water use per vehicle produced by Tesla was again below the industry average in 2021. Our new factories such as  Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg will set a new standard when it comes to low water use per vehicle. 73 - 74  Emissions Credits In 2021, Tesla delivered more than 2x as many EVs as our next closest competitor, helping drive $1.5bn in revenue  from selling regulatory credits. This money is being used to accelerate our production capacity deployment in  direct support of our mission.  75  \",\n",
       " '1 2 0  Summary – Product Impact  Topic Description Page(s) Product Affordability  (Price Equivalency &  Total Cost of Ownership)  Model 3 is price competitively with ICE equivalents. But, when compared on a total cost of ownership basis, the  Model 3 is much closer to a Toyota Camry on all-in cost per mile than to an ICE equivalent such as a BMW 3  Series.  77 - 78  Product Usage & Usability Our data shows that Tesla vehicles are being driven more than average vehicles in the U.S., suggesting that they  are generally being used as a customer’s primary vehicle. The superior range of our vehicles and a robust global  Supercharger Network makes this possible.  79 - 80  Vehicle Safety At Tesla, safety features are not optional. Our full suite of safety features comes standard with every vehicle.  When we design vehicles, first and foremost, we want them to be safe. Our active safety features are powered by  eight cameras, a neural-net computer and learnings from our fleet of over two million cars.   81 – 84  Autopilot Safety  In 2021, we recorded 0.22 crashes for every million miles driven in which drivers were using Autopilot technology  (Autosteer and active safety features). For drivers who were not using Autopilot technology (no Autosteer and  active safety features), we recorded 0.77 crashes for every million miles driven. By comparison, NHTSA’s most  recent data shows that in the United States there are 1.81 automobile crashes for every million miles driven.  85  Data Driven Safety Tesla strived to go beyond industry standard testing. We leverage data from our fleet of over two million cars to  better understand accidents and build solutions around them. 86 - 87  Passive Safety & Tesla Safety Awards Since 2019, Tesla vehicles earned 5-star ratings from safety rating agencies across the U.S., Europe and Australia. 88 - 89  Fire Risk From 2012 to 2021, there has been approximately five Tesla vehicle fires for every billion miles traveled. By  comparison, data from the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and U.S. Department of Transportation  show that in the U.S. there are 53 vehicle fires for every billion miles travelled.  90  Solar + Storage Products Pairing energy storage with renewables is required to transition our grid to zero-emission sources. In 2021, in  order to meet demand that is well in excess of supply for energy storage products, Tesla began building a new  production facility capable of producing 40,000,000 kWh of energy storage per year.  91- 92  Resilience of the Grid Electric grid disturbances in the U.S. have increased dramatically over the last 15 years. Our solar and storage  products not only deliver cost savings and energy independence, but they also harden the grid from adverse  events in a cost-effective and environmentally friendly manner.  93  ',\n",

Our responsible sourcing  strategy aims to increase the share of direct procurement and continually improve local conditions of the  communities from where we source.  95  Battery Recycling Tesla is building capacity to recycle manufacturing scrap and end of life batteries in order to close the loop on  battery raw materials. By the end of 2021, our battery recycling facility at Gigafactory Nevada achieved a  production rate of over 50 tons of recycled material per week.  96 - 97  Alignment with Best Practices Our responsible sourcing program is based on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Mineral Supply  Chains. This means Tesla collects data from its supply chain (including through audits), translates this data into  on-the-ground actions and discloses the outcomes in our annual Impact Report.  98  Battery Supply Chain  We have prioritized responsible sourcing activities for cobalt, lithium and nickel given their unique significance to  EVs and energy storage. To ensure we are appropriately managing risk, we continue to map our supply chain,  conduct in third-party audits and on-the-ground engagements, and collaborate with industry initiatives to ensure  our suppliers are living up to our strict standards.   99 - 111  Responsible Sourcing &  Tesla Supplier Audit Program  In 2018, Tesla initiated its Supplier Audit program with the objective to extend our supplier performance  evaluation to key environmental, social, and governance metrics relevant to Tesla’s business. As of the end of  2021, we had a total of 152 supplier locations go through our Suppler Audit at least once, representing 144  suppliers, or 10% of 2021 spend with our direct supply base.   112 - 115  ',\n",

       " '1 2 6  In 2021, we conducted a comprehensive materiality analysis to better understand the key ESG topics that were  most salient to our diverse group of stakeholders. To start, we identified over 40 issues in key areas that could  directly or indirectly impact our business. The topics ranged from economic, environmental, social and  governance issues. These issues were identified from four components: (1) a competitive landscape review, (2)  interviews with investors and other key external stakeholders, (3) industry reports and documented research,  such as the World Economic Forum’s 2021 Global Risks Report and (4) external ESG frameworks relevant to our  industry and regulatory requirements across global capital markets.  Tesla’s Sustainability Council refined the list of 40 key issues into a survey containing 25 questions in an effort  to help us prioritize these topics for operational management and disclosure in this year’s Impact Report. As  part of the assessment, we surveyed our key stakeholders, asking them to rate the identified economic and ESG  topics on a scale of 1-5, based on their perceived importance and impact to Tesla’s business. A total of 2,168  individuals from Tesla and approximately 40 external partners, including trade associations, universities,  suppliers, environmental consultants, nonprofits and local administrators, responded to the survey. 35% of  responses came from North America, 57% from China and 8% from Europe.

       " \"1 2 7  Appendix Supply Chain Policies  Tesla Human Rights Policy  Tesla believes the ethical treatment of all people and regard for human rights is core to our mission of a sustainable future and believe all businesses within our supply chain have a responsibility to  support our mission and share our respect for human rights. We endorse and base our definition of human rights on the United Nation's Universal Declaration for Human Rights (“UDHR”). The UDHR  focuses on dignity, respect, and equality, without discrimination, for all people. We are committed to upholding these rights and values throughout our value chain – including with respect to our  employees, customers, shareholders, suppliers, and the communities in which we operate.  Health and Safety  Suppliers are responsible for ensuring that their employees and  contractors are provided with a safe and healthy work  environment.  Respectful Workplace and Equal Opportunities  Tesla recognizes the value of different backgrounds and  perspectives in our workforce, and fully promotes equal  opportunity for all employees, both current and prospective.  Just as we do not discriminate on the basis of race, color,  religion, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression or  identity, national origin, disability, medical condition, military  and veteran status, marital status, pregnancy or any other  characteristic protected by law, regulation or ordinance, we  require our suppliers to similarly respect the people in their  workforces.  Environmental Protection  We expect our suppliers to share our goal of recognizing  environmental protection as a key principle of a sustainable  future.  Child Labor and Young Workers  Tesla strictly follows local and national laws restricting the  employment of underage workers. Regardless of local laws, no  workers at a facility or location that provides materials used in  Tesla products may be under the age of 15.  Relationship with Communities  Tesla is dedicated to being a responsible member of the  communities in which we live and operate. This goes beyond our  ability to create jobs and contribute to local value creation. We  expect suppliers to also take every effort to continuously  improve the positive aspects and reduce any negative impact of  their operations on the local community, including with respect  to environmental, social, and other quality of life factors.  Indigenous Rights  The mining industry on which Tesla relies to source many raw  materials that go into our products has historically had an  adverse impact on the rights of indigenous peoples and  communities in the areas in which they operate. For all raw  material extraction and processing used in Tesla products, we  expect our mining industry suppliers to engage with legitimate  representatives of indigenous communities and include the right  to free and informed consent in their operations.  The following tables provide summaries of our responsible sourcing policies, the full text of which can be found on our Responsible Sourcing Policies page:  https://www.tesla.com/legal/additional-resources#responsible-sourcing-policies  \\n1 2 8  The following tables provide summaries of our responsible sourcing policies, the full text of which can be found on our Responsible Sourcing Policies page:  Appendix Supply Chain Policies  Tesla Responsible Materials Policy  Suppliers are required to use reasonable efforts to ensure that  their parts and products supplied to Tesla do not contribute to  armed conflict, human rights abuses, or environmental  degradation, regardless of sourcing location. For all materials  used in Tesla products, Tesla requires its suppliers to establish  policies, due diligence frameworks, and management systems  consistent with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for  Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected  and High-Risk Areas or the OECD Guidelines for Multinational  Enterprises.

       " '1 3 4  Appendix  Metric / Disclosure / Topic Source(s) Methodology / Definition  Vehicle use-phase emissions, which represent 80-90% of total automotive emissions  (included in Scope 3 of ESG reporting), tend to be misreported due to the use of  unrealistic assumptions or not reported at all. OEM sustainability reports  Analysis of sustainability reports by auto OEMs shows unrealistic assumptions for both vehicle life and annual  mileage. For those that disclose their methodology we have found that vehicle life is often estimated to be as low  as 10 years and annual distance traveled by vehicles as low as 6,200 miles. This compares to an average life of 17  years in the U.S. (20 years in Europe) and 12,000 annual miles in the U.S. (and 7,450 in Europe). When taken  together, even before considering the impacts of using real-world MPG instead of NEDC, WLTP or EPA ratings, this  leads to a drastic under-reporting of Scope 3 emissions.  8.4 million metric tons of CO2e savings Tesla estimate  To estimate CO2e savings, we first measured the amount of miles driven by our vehicles and kWh of electricity  generated and stored by our solar panels and energy storage products at the state, province, and country level for  2021. We then applied an emissions savings factor (in gCO2e/mi for miles driven and gCO2e/kWh for electricity  generated), for each state, province, and country to estimate CO2e avoided. For miles driven, the emissions savings  factor is the net of estimated emissions from our vehicles and an ICE with a real-world fuel efficiency rating of ~24  mpg. The emissions savings factor is based on grid emissions intensity in each respective location and includes  upstream emissions from the production and transport of fuels.

Scope 2 emissions (location-based) are indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy.  Scope 3 emissions are all indirect emissions (not included in scope 2) that occur in the value chain of the reporting  company, including both upstream and downstream emissions. Emissions from the use of a company’s products are  included in Scope 3.  6,500 miles At the moment, the manufacturing process of a Model 3 results in slightly higher  GHG emissions than an equivalent combustion engine vehicle. However, based on  the global weighted average grid mix, a Model 3 has lower lifetime emissions than an  equivalent ICE after driving 6,500 miles. Tesla estimate  Estimate is based on the difference in CO2e emissions from the average of manufacturing phase of a Model 3 and  Model Y and an equivalent ICE which is then divided by the net CO2e savings per mile from a Model 3 and Model Y  versus an equivalent ICE. Net CO2e savings are based on delivery-weighted global grid mix.  70 tons: Lifetime CO2 emitted by an average combustion engine vehicle (model year  2021) sold in the U.S. through its use-phase, excluding CO2 emitted during the oil  refining phase.

       " \"1 3 6  Appendix  Metric / Disclosure / Topic Source(s) Methodology / Definition  Manufacturing Phase Emissions for Average Mid-Size Premium ICE Tesla, Sphera Solutions  In order to estimate the cradle-to-gate carbon footprints (GWP100) of select benchmark vehicles, a simplified  approach of multiplying their curb weights by a carbon intensity of ~5.5 kg CO2e/kg was chosen. This reference  value is based on a currently produced mid-size premium sedan that is comparable to the Model 3. The accuracy of  this estimate for the other ICE vehicles directly depends on how their material compositions compared to that of  the reference vehicle as well as on the existing variability of environmental impact profiles across different  geographies and suppliers.  As such, the specific carbon footprint (GWP100/kg) of the reference vehicle is only a proxy for the average  premium mid-size ICE vehicle. Based on past work on automotive LCAs (Rohde-Brandenburger & Koffler, 2019)  (Koffler C. 873 , 2013) (Koffler C. , 2010) (Koffler C. , Krinke, Schebek, & Buchgeister, 2008) (Koffler C. , 2007), the  uncertainty of these estimates is estimated to be less than ±20% for a cradle-to-gate system boundary, and  therefore less than ±5% once the use-phase is added.  The reference manufacturer’s Environmental Certificates are calculated using the same BOM import functionality of  the GaBi DfX software used for the Model 3 in the LCA authored by Sphera as well as GaBi 878 databases for all  background data.  Benchmark mid-size premium ICE vehicles include BMW 330i 2.0, Audi A4 2.0, Mercedes-Benz C300 2.0, Alfa  Romeo Giulia 2.0, Volvo S60 2.0, Cadillac ATS 2.0, Lexus IS 300 2.0 and Infiniti Q50 2.0. Benchmark cross-over SUV premium ICE vehicles include BMW X3, Audi Q5, Mercedes GLC, Jaguar F-Pace, AR  Stelvio, Volvo XC60, Cadillac XT5, Lexus NX and Porsche Macan.  Use-phase Emissions for Average Mid-Size Premium ICE Consumer Reports  Figured based on owner-reported fuel economy from Consumer Reports for the latest available model year (2018- 2020, depending on the make/model). 24.8 MPG is representative of the average of Alfa Romeo Giulia , Audi A4,  BMW 330i, Cadillac ATS, Infiniti Q50, Lexus IS 300, Mercedes-Benz C300, and Volvo S60. use-phase GWP100 of  ~400 gCO2e/mi includes gasoline production and distribution emissions from GaBi 2019 databases as well as  consideration of bio-fuel mix of gasoline in the U.S. (~12%).  Manufacturing Phase Emissions for Model 3 and Model Y Tesla  Figure inclusive of: raw and semi-finished material production including transportation, mechanical processing and  shaping, battery manufacturing, vehicle assembly and paint shop, all fuels and energy (natural gas, electricity, etc.),  other auxiliaries (lubricants, water, etc.) and end-of-life disposal.

Excluded activities are estimated to represent minor contributions to the cradle-to-gate  as well as the overall LCA results.  Where solar and storage are assumed to be a fuel source for the use-phase of the Model 3Y, emissions were  included in the manufacturing phase figure. The Model 3Y Rideshare Use (solar charged) scenario is allocated 100%  of these emissions on a per mile basis, while the Model 3Y Personal Use (solar charged) scenario is allocated 82% of  these emissions and 18% grid-charged emissions on a per mile basis (based on observed supercharging vs. other  split).

In order to be conservative, and normalize our figure based  on recent vehicle sales trends in each region, we divided total vehicle parc by average vehicles sales in the  respective regions for 2019 and 2020 (latest available data). This resulted in a scrappage age of 17 years and  200,000 miles in the U.S. and 20 years and 150,000 miles for Europe.

(Tesla) asserts that  the GHG emissions metrics are presented in accordance with the assessment criteria set  forth below.   Management is responsible for the selection of the criteria, which management believes  provide an objective basis for measuring and reporting on the GHG emissions metrics,  and for the completeness, accuracy, and validity of the GHG emissions metrics. Tesla’s  GHG emissions are rounded to the nearest thousand.   Organizational Boundary  Tesla uses the operational control approach to account for and report its Scope 1 and  Scope 2 GHG emissions. This includes sites engaged in manufacturing; sales, service, and  delivery; and other activities described below. Data for acquired sites are included once  the site has been operating for at least a year at the beginning of the reporting period.  Management Assertion  Scope 1 & 2 GHG Emissions  GHG Emissions Disclosure  1. Tesla considers the principles and guidance of the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the  World Business Council for Sustainable Development’s (WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol  Initiative’s A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Revised Edition, and GHG  Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, An amendment to the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard  (together the “GHG Protocol”) to guide the criteria to assess, calculate and report direct  and indirect GHG emissions.  2. GHG emissions quantification is subject to significant inherent measurement uncertainty  because of such things as GHG emissions factors that are used in mathematical models to  calculate GHG emissions, and the inability of these models, due to incomplete scientific  knowledge and other factors, to accurately measure under all circumstances the relationship  between various inputs and the resultant GHG emissions. Environmental and energy use  data used in GHG emissions calculations are subject to inherent limitations, given the nature  and the methods used for measuring such data. The selection by management of different  but acceptable measurement techniques could have resulted in materially different amounts  or metrics being reported.

We strive to be the best on every metric relevant to our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. To maximize our impact, we plan to continue increasing our production volumes and the accessibility of our products. In more concrete terms, this means that by 2030 we are aiming to sell 20 million electric vehicles per year (compared to 0.94 million in 2021) and deploy 1,500 GWh of energy storage per year (compared to 4 GWh in 2021). If we were to achieve such a vehicle delivery milestone through a consistent growth rate, the total Tesla vehicle fleet would surpass tens of millions of vehicles by 2030, and each of those vehicles could save tons of CO2e emissions every year of usage. Furthermore, each product we make must be continuously improved at each step of its lifecycle: from manufacturing to consumer use to recycling. We must also improve every metric, including the energy and water used to make our products, how safe our customers and employees are and the affordability and accessibility of our products.

We emphasize structuring compensation to reward our named executive officers based on performance, and equity awards weigh heavily in our named executive officers’ total compensation, including awards that vest upon the achievement of clear and measurable milestones. Since these awards increase in value as our stock price increases (and in the case of stock option awards, have no value unless our stock price increases following their grant), our named executive officers’ incentives are closely aligned with the long-term interests of our stockholders. Tesla has no cash bonus program for any of our named executive officers and generally does not provide any perquisites or tax reimbursements to our named executive officers that are not available to other employees. No named executive officer has any severance or change of control arrangement, except as reflected in Elon Musk’s performance-based 2018 CEO Performance Award. A change in control modifies the vesting requirements of the 2018 CEO Performance Award such that vesting of the Award’s tranches would be measured based on Tesla’s market capitalization at the time of the change of the control, without regard to the operational milestones of the Award. Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, historically earned a base salary that reflected the applicable minimum wage requirements under California law, and he was subject to income taxes based on such base salary. However, he has never accepted his salary. Commencing in May 2019 at Mr. Musk’s request, we eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of this base salary. Consequently, 100% of Mr. Musk’s compensation is at-risk. Similarly, the compensation program for Tesla’s non-employee directors is designed to be consistent with our compensation philosophy for our employees, with an emphasis on equity-based compensation over cash in order to align the value of their compensation with the market value of our stock, and consequently, with the long-term interests of our stockholders. Moreover, while we offer to our general employee population restricted stock units that will retain some value even if the market value of our stock decreases, the equity-based compensation to our directors has been exclusively in the form of stock options, which have zero initial value and accumulate value, if at all, only to the extent that our stock price increases following their grant, through the applicable vesting dates and until such stock options are ultimately exercised and the underlying shares are sold. The remaining portion of our directors’ compensation has been comprised of cash retainer payments that are relatively modest compared to peer companies and that may be waived at the election of each director. Further, in June 2021, the Board adopted a resolution that all existing directors forego any automatic grants of annual stock option awards under our director compensation policy until July 2022 unless the Board determines otherwise.',\n",

For Tesla vehicles, customer personal data is protected from the moment they take delivery, ensuring that by default the vehicle data generated when driving is not associated with the customer's account or vehicle identification number. Tesla also puts customers in the driver’s seat when it comes to data sharing by providing a dedicated in-vehicle menu to adjust preferences at any time. Additionally, from Powerwall to Solar Roof, energy products are designed to protect customer privacy. Tesla aims to collect a minimum amount of personal data necessary in providing the most engaging in-app energy experience. In furtherance of transparency, Tesla has developed a seamless way for customers to download and access their energy data at any time right from the Tesla app. Engaging the security community We are also focused on ensuring that our vehicles are the most secure on the road. To do that, our team of world-class engineers works day in and day out to ensure that our systems are always as secure as possible. And while some of the best security engineers work at Tesla, we believe that in order to design and build inherently secure systems, we cannot work alone. We work closely with the security research community to benefit from their collective expertise and diversity of thought. Continuous product improvement Tesla pioneered the concept of vehicles that improve and become more capable over time by ensuring that every Tesla vehicle made since 2012 can accept over-the-air (OTA) software updates. These updates have introduced new features and functionality that have made our vehicles smarter, safer and more enjoyable to drive. We have also used the OTA system to ensure that our vehicles are not only as secure as possible when they are delivered, but that they continue to stay as secure as possible throughout their lifetime.\",\n",

In 2021, Tesla’s average national wage for manufacturing jobs in the U.S. was $21.60/hour plus benefits (which, among others listed on the next page, includes an option for $0 cost paycheck deductions) and equity, which is a 2.2% increase compared to 2020. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the mean hourly wage for Production Associates / Assemblers is $18.17 and the median is $17.59. Tesla continuously reviews salary and wages against benchmarks and adjusts to ensure wages are competitive. Evaluations for promotions also take place annually. The impact of stock-based compensation can be material for employees Our employees have benefited enormously from value appreciation of our stock seen through the years. While share prices will remain volatile and past performance is not indicative of future results, stock-based compensation brings shared ownership to the workforce, and our employees are encouraged to make a positive change for the benefit of all. Culturally, shared ownership of the company is one of the most essential attributes of working at Tesla. For example, assume that an employee received a grant of 320 Tesla shares in 2018 that vested 20 shares quarterly over 16 quarters (4 years). Based on the stock price at the time of the grant, the quarterly vest of 20 Tesla shares would equate to $1,331-worth of sellable shares at the end of 2018. However, the same vest two years later would equate to $14,113-worth of sellable shares per quarter based on the increase in the price per share of Tesla stock over that period.

       " 'Diversity data (EEO-1) for U.S. employees: Tesla is a majority-minority company We are proud to be a majority-minority company with a large representation of employees from communities that have long struggled to break through the historic roadblocks to equal opportunity in the U.S. As of December 31, 2020, 34% of our directors and vice presidents were non-white. This is a large percentage, considering that just 0.3% of our employees are director level and above at Tesla. We are working to increase minority representation in professional and management categories through our intentional recruiting efforts with Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions, activations at the National Society of Black Engineers, the Society of Hispanic Engineers, AfroTech, as well as community partnerships with organizations like College Track and Black Girls Code. We are also working to ensure that the diversity in our entry-level roles will, over time and because of internal movement, be reflected in our leadership roles.',\n",

In nearly all categories, Tesla’s representation of people of color exceeds that of peer companies. We are working to increase gender representation throughout the company by supporting women-focused organizations and conferences like Society of Women Engineers, Latinas In Tech, TechUp For Women, Silicon Valley Forum, Women in Technology Festival, Women in Technology International and Women in Manufacturing. We also launched Tesla Recharge Returnship Program – a four-month paid work program that initially targeted women impacted by the pandemic and later expanded to support all mid-career professionals transitioning back into the workforce after a leave of one year or more. The table below shows Tesla employee distribution compared to average employee distribution of U.S. tech companies. Values that are higher than the tech company average distribution are shown with positive values and green shading. Values that are lower than the average are shown with negative values and yellow shading.',\n",
